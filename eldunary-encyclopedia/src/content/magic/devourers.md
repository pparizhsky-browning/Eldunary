**Devourers** are an extraordinarily rare hereditary magi classification. Devourers do not cast, channel, or store magic — they absorb it from living sources passively and involuntarily. No known Magi classification system in use on Criozevan currently contains this category; scholars who have encountered evidence of it have historically misattributed the effects to illness, curse, or unusual environmental conditions.

## Mechanism

The Devourer ability operates constantly and without conscious activation. Magic users within proximity of a Devourer find their reserves slowly depleting. The stronger the Devourer's emotional state, the larger the radius and the faster the rate of absorption. At full emotional extremity, a Devourer can strip a magic user's power entirely — temporarily or, in severe cases, permanently.

## Passive vs. Active

In its passive form the drain is gradual and imperceptible to both parties. In its active form — triggered only by extreme emotion, never by will — it is acute and potentially catastrophic. No known Devourer has ever consciously controlled the active form. Learning to release absorbed energy consciously, rather than holding it indefinitely, is considered the central challenge of the classification.

## The Release

Absorbed magical energy does not remain inert. A Devourer who has accumulated significant reserves and releases them — voluntarily or involuntarily — produces a discharge of raw undifferentiated magical energy. This manifests as a shockwave affecting all magic users in the area simultaneously: weaker mages are overwhelmed; stronger ones experience a violent surge. The release does not target. It radiates. In the hours following a major release, the Devourer absorbs faster and more desperately than normal — a temporary void state that is dangerous to any magic user nearby. The carrier typically experiences this as an unusual calm, making it one of the most dangerous periods.

## Interaction with Corrupted Magic

Devourer energy and corrupted magical energy are fundamentally opposed. Corrupted runes in the presence of a Devourer become unstable and recoil — their dark energy destabilized by contact with the absorption field. This effect is involuntary and occurs even when the Devourer is unaware of the runes' presence.

## The Goldhelm Bloodline

The only confirmed Devourer bloodline in recorded history is the Goldhelm royal line. The ability has diluted significantly over a thousand years of non-use — most modern Goldhelm royals carry only trace amounts insufficient to cause observable effects. The current generation has produced one individual in whom the full ancestral power has re-expressed: **Princess Seraphina**. The reason for this re-expression is unknown.

## Historical Classification

The oldest known reference to Devourers appears in a pre-Convergence Folkwynd oral tradition fragment, preserved in a single damaged text held in the Klanron archive. The fragment uses a word that translates roughly as *the hungry ones* or, in more poetic rendering, *those who remember what the world was before magic had a shape.* No Magi scholar in the current era has connected this fragment to the Goldhelm bloodline.

## Distribution

**Population:** Effectively one known active carrier in the current era (Seraphina). The classification does not appear in any modern Magi taxonomy.
