**Metas** are not a magic system in the way that malefici, runestones, or holotech are magic systems — they are not learnable, not teachable, not the product of study or training or talent development. They are abilities that emerge, under conditions that have resisted systematic analysis, in individuals who then possess them without having done anything in particular to produce them. The Magic Societies classify them separately from all other ability categories precisely because no pedagogical framework applies.

The defining characteristic of a Meta ability is that it does not operate within the laws that govern other magical systems. A malefici practitioner can amplify power but cannot exceed what malefici theory predicts as maximum output for a given energy input. A Meta ability does not have a predictable maximum output — it represents a relationship between the practitioner and their ability that is not mediated by the physical laws that constrain everything else. Fluffy is the clearest example: no theoretical framework currently predicts what Fluffy can or cannot do.

**Documentation** of Meta abilities is primarily observational — the Magic Societies' records describe observed effects and the conditions under which they were observed, without explanatory models. The Vorryn case is the closest thing to a developmental hypothesis the Societies have: a connection to something beyond normal magical systems (X'zel's divine connection, filtered through the Last Drone's unique biological circumstance) producing an ability profile that exceeds what the practitioner's classified power inputs would generate.

The **power ranking implications** of Meta classification are straightforward in principle and unsatisfying in practice: Meta is above every other class, which tells you the comparative ordering and nothing about the actual capability ceiling, because the ceiling hasn't been identified.
