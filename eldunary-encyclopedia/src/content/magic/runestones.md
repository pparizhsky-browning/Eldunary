summary: "The external inscription-based magic system. Power stored in carved runes rather than generated internally. Golems use it as their entire biology. Karthrun is the primary runestone language. Permanent and accumulative."

**Runestones** operate entirely differently from malefici: where malefici draws power from internal generation, runestones store and direct power through physical inscription. A carved rune holds magical potential the way a battery holds electrical energy — it can be charged externally, holds that charge indefinitely until activated, and releases its effect when the activation conditions are met. The practitioner's personal power level does not limit the rune's effect; the quality of the inscription and the amount of power stored in it does.

This makes runestones the most accessible form of sustained magical effect for practitioners whose own malefici reservoir is limited — a mediocre malefici practitioner with an expertly carved runestone can produce effects that exceed their personal capability. The trade-off is time (inscription takes hours or days for complex runes), material (only specific stone compositions accept reliable inscription), and expertise (an incorrectly carved rune does not simply fail — it releases its stored power in unpredictable ways).

**Karthrun** is the primary language for runestone inscription — the Golem language that the Golem King invented for encoding consciousness into stone, which has been adapted by surface practitioners for broader runestone applications. The Golems' entire existence is runestone magic: a Golem is a runestone array sophisticated enough to produce autonomous cognition, which is why Varnokh's inscription expertise is as critical to the Golem race as any biological function is to organic species.

The **geological distribution** of suitable inscription stone across Criozevan maps almost exactly to the current territorial distribution of runestone practitioners — the stone is in the mountains, the Golems and their tradition are in the mountains, and the Nikolem Kingdom's resource wealth derives substantially from this geographic accident.
