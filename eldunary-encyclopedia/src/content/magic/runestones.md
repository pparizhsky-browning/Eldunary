**Runestones** are magic users who can only control their power through a runestone, weapon, or item. They make up 45% of all Magi — the most common type.

Many powerful sorcerers (such as Merlin) place their runestone jewel inside a staff or ring.

Golems have high affinity to rune magic and act as living batteries for enchanted gear. The Nikolem Kingdom is rich in rune magic and forges, where rune users train, acquire Runestones, and craft infused gear.

Runestones are banned in the Goldhelm Kingdom.
