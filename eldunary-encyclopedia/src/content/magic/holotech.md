**Holotech** is technology that mimics magic. It was developed solely by the Goldhelm Kingdom. Magic is completely banned inside the Goldhelm Kingdom, with use punishable by public execution. Holotech is used in its place for everyday life, warfare, and industry.

Holotech applications in the Goldhelm military include: holo-tech war axes, multi-layered holo-armor, holo-shields, holo-tech bows and arrows, holo-tech swords, and holo-tech spears. Infrastructure uses include hover-rails, stone roads, and bridge networks.

Frada also produces holotech — the Holo-Tech Forge Docks in Hiypolis produce custom holo-tech weaponry for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

Noteworthy Goldhelm institutions include the **Department of Holometric Advancement** (scientific arm of the government) and the **Auric Vanguard** (Goldhelm's military force that uses holotech).
