summary: "The internal magic system. Draws power from the practitioner's own life force — mana generated internally. Mastery requires will development alongside technical training. The most widely practiced formal magic system."

**Malefici** is the magic system that most practitioners in Criozevan reference when they say "magic" without a qualifier — the internal generation and direction of mana through will, training, and the developed capacity to shape that force into external effects. Every formal magic academic institution teaches malefici as the foundation course. Every other system is compared to it.

The system draws power from the practitioner's own life force — a renewable internal reservoir that regenerates through rest, nutrition, and emotional regulation, but that depletes with use and is permanently bounded by the individual's physical and psychological capacity. This means malefici has a real ceiling at the individual level: a practitioner cannot exceed what their body and mind can generate and sustain. The ranking differences between practitioners are partly skill-based and partly this reservoir capacity — the reason Veles and the Crimson Knight operate at the levels they do is that their reservoirs are larger than any catalogued comparable.

**Will development** is the distinguishing requirement: malefici technical training teaches the forms, the shapes, the directional control of mana. But without the will to force those forms into reality at need — the mental capacity to hold a complex spell construction under pressure, the psychological fortitude to continue drawing when the reservoir is running low — technical technique produces nothing. This is why malefici masters tend to be exceptional people in the character sense: the training selects for psychological resilience that has applications beyond magic.

The Butterfly organization's most visible oversight function is malefici-focused: the practitioner registry, the adverse incident monitoring, and the magical resonance surveys that identify unusual concentrations of malefici activity are all primarily tracking this system. It is the most common form of magical power and therefore the most common form of magical accident.
