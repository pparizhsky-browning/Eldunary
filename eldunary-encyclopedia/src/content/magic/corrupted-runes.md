summary: "The Darkmane Elf-specific corrupted version of standard runestone practice. Draws from void energy rather than natural magical substrate. More powerful than standard runes but unstable and dangerous to practitioner. The Fallen Way."
---

**Corrupted Runes** are what runestone magic becomes when its inscription medium is not natural stone but void-adjacent material — physical substrates that have been exposed to the same void energy that drove X'zel from Criozevan and corrupted the Tharnex hive network. The Darkmane Elves encountered this corruption during the First Great War period, and the branch of their cultural practice that absorbed it became the **Fallen Way**: more powerful than the ancestral rune tradition, more dangerous, and irreversibly different.

The power difference is real and substantial: corrupted rune effects exceed standard runestone equivalents at the same inscription complexity by a significant margin, because void energy has fewer limiting interactions with the physical world than normal magical substrate. A standard runestone cannot, for example, produce Vaelith's Hollow Void ability or Azaraith's Rune Collapse — these require the void-adjacent substrate that corrupted runes provide access to.

The **instability cost** is the trade: corrupted runes are difficult to inscribe accurately because the void material is inherently resistant to precise control, the stored charges decay faster than standard rune charges and must be maintained with ongoing effort, and extended use of high-power corrupted rune abilities has physiological effects on practitioners that standard runestones do not produce. Azaraith's long exposure to corrupted rune energy has changed him in ways that long-term study could document but has not been able to fully characterize. Vaelith's Hollow Void is the most dramatic example of a corrupted rune effect that has permanently altered the practitioner's physical structure.

The Butterfly organization monitors the Darkmane Realm's corrupted rune concentration zones because the ambient void-adjacent energy in those zones is not stable — it is slowly expanding, which means the boundary between standard and corrupted rune practice is moving. Where it stops is not currently predictable.
