**Corrupted Runes** are massive, unstable runes left by the Golem King deep in the forests of the Warring Darkmane Realm. They became unstable after the Golem King stopped maintaining them because of the ongoing war. They are prone to explosions and emit dark magic that can infect the mind — often fatal.

Dark elves draw corrupted energy from these abandoned Golem runes. Abilities derived from them include Shadowstep, silence binding, and toxin shaping.
