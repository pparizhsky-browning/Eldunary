**Hell** is a separate dimension. It is not a metaphor, a spiritual destination, or a theological construct unique to any one religion in Criozevan — it is a real place, physically distinct from Eldunary, that can be accessed through specific dark magical practices.

## Hell Malefici

**Hell Malefici** — the rarest subcategory of Dark Malefici, comprising approximately **2% of that group** — specialize in opening connections to this dimension for the purpose of summoning the creatures that inhabit it. The classification is recognized but extremely uncommon; most people in Criozevan will never encounter one.

## What Is Known

The dimension's existence is documented. Its nature is not. What hell is, who or what governs it, and what its inhabitants want from the world of Eldunary are questions that do not have answers in any publicly available source.

## Known Connections

**Berserk (#2 Arashi)** made a direct pact with a being from this dimension in exchange for power. The terms of the pact, the identity of the being, and what was offered in exchange are not known.

Hell Malefici sightings have been reported near **Anehull** (Kingdom of Vacron) — unconfirmed, though the Crimson Rooks maintain active surveillance of the area.
