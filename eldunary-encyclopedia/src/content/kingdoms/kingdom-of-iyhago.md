## Capital & Settlements

- Iyhago Prime (Island Capital): A spiraling sanctuary where each district represents an aspect of the Quiet Harmonic. The highest point houses the Sanctum Spiral where the ruler resides. Access requires ritual purification and a silence oath. Located on the southern island called Vehalo, accessible by three sacred bridges. Port city and sea trade hub. Friendly to outsiders.
- Uyrand: Plains town known for memory archives and mirrored halls inside towering, skyscraper-like buildings. Rose HQ. Nothing otherwise special.
- Andport: The primary western gate — crossed only after ritual oath-walking. Southwestern port town. Bridge connecting to the Republic of Frada. Controls goods passing from northwest to south.
- Ubraamore: Bridge and checkpoint city into Iyhago's island. Crimson Rooks outpost. Secretly the black market tech trade capital.

## Geography & Environment

Mainland of terraced hills, rivers, and elevated cities aligned by spiritual principles. Movement and city design follow spiritual symmetry — every route has meaning.

## Government & Religion — The Quiet Harmonic

A religious theocracy. Life is structured around silence, memory, and sacred speech. Bridges, reflection, and ritual geometry guide architecture and law. Worship centers on stillness, reflection, and the belief that balance creates divinity. Prayer involves movement and posture — speech is rare and sacred. Public rituals are silent. Sacred texts are visual, revealed through mirrored surfaces. Children learn silence and posture before they learn language. Unauthorized use of sacred speech is a serious offense. Festivals are wordless light-processions. Laws are echoed by chime bells, not voices.

## Ruler — Veles, Master of Magic

Speaks only through harmonic pulses interpreted by chosen attendants. Believed to commune directly with the divine pattern guiding the kingdom.

## Military — The Resonant Guard

Elite force of Spellers trained in sacred speech-based magic called Kōtoba. Words are weapons — a single syllable can reshape memory, space, or structure. Guards spend years in silence before casting their first phrase. Ranks: Initiates (The Voiceless) → Active field casters → High-commanders (speak only once per cycle).

## Notable History

**Veles and the Great War (795–800 ACC):** Veles was born in Iyhago and had long been respected across the continent before the Great War (also known as the Golden War). During the war, he sided with the South Goldhelm faction because he genuinely believed their fight for political autonomy was a just cause. When the war ended with the Equinox of Power, the people of Iyhago voted him to the throne in recognition of his role in the conflict. He expanded the kingdom’s territory to its current borders over the following decades.
 Built on tone, breath, posture, and silence as much as vocabulary. Key terms: sha (balance), thi (form), vala (voice), yunai (silence), eshar (erasure). Kōtoba is a refined form of Shayathi used only by the Resonant Guard. Unauthorized use of advanced Shayathi is forbidden and spiritually dangerous.
## Pre-Kingdom History — The Vehalo Territories

Before Veles took power and established the Kingdom of Iyhago, the territory that now comprises the kingdom was known as the **Vehalo Territories** — named after the island of Vehalo, on which the city of Iyhago (then simply called Iyhago, without the "Prime") was located. The Vehalo Territories consisted of two primary settlements: the island city of Iyhago and the town of Ubraamore, along with the surrounding coastal area comprising roughly the southwesternmost portion of what is now Iyhago's mainland holdings.

The Vehalo Territories were not a kingdom or a formal state — they operated as a loose semi-autonomous region with no centralized government and no territorial ambitions. They were known primarily as a port of spiritual significance and a minor trade point.

Veles was born in Iyhago when it was still part of the Vehalo Territories. He had already become a widely recognized and respected figure on the continent before the Great War. When the war ended and Veles returned home, the people of the Vehalo Territories voted him to leadership. He renamed the settlement Iyhago Prime, established the Kingdom of Iyhago, and began a quiet, steady expansion of territory over the following decades that brought the kingdom to its current borders.

The **Eshar-Thi** — a union of Uyrand and Andport that had been conquered by Frada in 730 ACC — was eventually absorbed into Iyhago's expanding territory as the Azure Paladin's grip on the region dissolved following his departure from Frada. The exact circumstances and date of this absorption are not well-documented.
