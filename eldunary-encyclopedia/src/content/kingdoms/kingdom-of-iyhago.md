*In Iyhago, silence is not the absence of speech. It is the highest form of it.*

The **Kingdom of Iyhago** is organized around a single religious and philosophical principle: the **Quiet Harmonic** — the belief that balance creates divinity, and that silence is the medium through which the divine communicates. Children here learn posture and breath before they learn words. Festivals are wordless light-processions. Laws are proclaimed through chime bells, not voices. Sacred texts are not read — they are revealed through mirrored surfaces when light strikes at the correct angle.

To an outsider, Iyhago feels uncanny: a kingdom of great cities where the ambient sound level is barely above a forest's. To its residents, any kingdom where people shout across streets is simply incomprehensible.

## Capital & Settlements

**Iyhago Prime** (Island Capital) spirals upward on the island of Vehalo, each district representing an aspect of the Quiet Harmonic. The highest point holds the **Sanctum Spiral**, where **Veles** resides and communes. Access requires ritual purification and a silence oath. Three sacred bridges connect to the mainland; entry without the oath is turned away. Port city and sea trade hub. Friendly to outsiders who follow the customs.

**Uyrand** — Vertical town: skyscraper-like towers housing memory archives and mirrored halls. **Rose HQ**. The organization conducts its covert operations from here, presumably because the culture of silence makes surveillance difficult.

**Andport** — Primary western gate. Crossed only after ritual oath-walking. Bridge connecting to the Republic of Frada. Controls goods from northwest to south.

**Ubraamore** — Checkpoint town into Iyhago island. **Crimson Rooks outpost**. Secretly the black market tech trade capital of the island region.

## Government: The Quiet Harmonic

A religious theocracy. Life is structured around silence, memory, and sacred speech. Movement and city design follow spiritual symmetry — every route has meaning, every building is oriented relative to sacred principles.

**Veles, Master of Magic** speaks only through harmonic pulses interpreted by chosen attendants. Believed to commune directly with the divine pattern. His power level is equal to Sunlee and Selvarin — the three Masters fought to a stalemate at the Equinox of Power.

## Military: The Resonant Guard

Elite force of Spellers trained in **Kōtoba** — sacred speech-based magic where single syllables can reshape memory, space, or structure. Guards spend years in silence before casting their first phrase. Unauthorized Kōtoba use is forbidden and spiritually dangerous.

Ranks: *Initiates (The Voiceless)* → *Active field casters* → *High-commanders (speak only once per cycle)*.

## Language: Shayathi

Built on tone, breath, posture, and silence. Key terms: *sha* (balance), *thi* (form), *vala* (voice), *yunai* (silence), *eshar* (erasure). Kōtoba is a refined form used only by the Resonant Guard.
