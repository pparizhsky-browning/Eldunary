## Capital & Settlements

- Iyhago Prime (Island Capital): A spiraling sanctuary where each district represents an aspect of the Quiet Harmonic. The highest point houses the Sanctum Spiral where the ruler resides. Access requires ritual purification and a silence oath. Located on the southern island called Vehalo, accessible by three sacred bridges. Port city and sea trade hub. Friendly to outsiders.
- Uyrand: Plains town known for memory archives and mirrored halls inside towering, skyscraper-like buildings. Rose HQ. Nothing otherwise special.
- Andport: The primary western gate — crossed only after ritual oath-walking. Southwestern port town. Bridge connecting to the Republic of Frada. Controls goods passing from northwest to south.
- Ubraamore: Bridge and checkpoint city into Iyhago's island. Crimson Rooks outpost. Secretly the black market tech trade capital.

## Geography & Environment

Mainland of terraced hills, rivers, and elevated cities aligned by spiritual principles. Movement and city design follow spiritual symmetry — every route has meaning.

## Government & Religion — The Quiet Harmonic

A religious theocracy. Life is structured around silence, memory, and sacred speech. Bridges, reflection, and ritual geometry guide architecture and law. Worship centers on stillness, reflection, and the belief that balance creates divinity. Prayer involves movement and posture — speech is rare and sacred. Public rituals are silent. Sacred texts are visual, revealed through mirrored surfaces. Children learn silence and posture before they learn language. Unauthorized use of sacred speech is a serious offense. Festivals are wordless light-processions. Laws are echoed by chime bells, not voices.

## Ruler — Veles, Master of Magic

Speaks only through harmonic pulses interpreted by chosen attendants. Believed to commune directly with the divine pattern guiding the kingdom.

## Military — The Resonant Guard

Elite force of Spellers trained in sacred speech-based magic called Kōtoba. Words are weapons — a single syllable can reshape memory, space, or structure. Guards spend years in silence before casting their first phrase. Ranks: Initiates (The Voiceless) → Active field casters → High-commanders (speak only once per cycle).

## Language — Shayathi

Sacred language used in worship, law, and magical casting. Built on tone, breath, posture, and silence as much as vocabulary. Key terms: sha (balance), thi (form), vala (voice), yunai (silence), eshar (erasure). Kōtoba is a refined form of Shayathi used only by the Resonant Guard. Unauthorized use of advanced Shayathi is forbidden and spiritually dangerous.
