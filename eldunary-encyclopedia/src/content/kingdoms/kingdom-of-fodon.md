*The sand remembers. Fodon's desert holds memory the way the Tharnex said all things did — and in Fodon's case, the memory is mostly violence.*

The **Kingdom of Fodon** occupies the northwestern peninsula of Criozevan — harsh desert, dry plains, jagged cliffs, and scorched canyons. Once warmer, now wind-blasted. The land itself seems hostile in a way that goes beyond climate: it resists comfort, discourages softness, and rewards only those who can survive it without complaint.

## Capital & Districts

**Fodon** (Capital) is the second largest city in Criozevan. The city was defined for decades by division into four war-torn districts — *Bug*, *Magic*, *Death*, and *Fire* — each controlled by a warlord and perpetually at war with the others:

- **Vorvax** (Bug District) — Rumored to be the last matriarch of the Tharnex race. Ruled from the shadows with shifting armor that sensed incoming danger. When she was killed by Lucifer, the remaining Tharnex perished.
- **Azaraith, the Nightweaver** (Magic District) — Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces through a staff. Even the Arashi hesitated to challenge her. Her mask's face was never revealed.
- **Varnokh** (Death District) — A towering armored construct powered by a magenta arcane core. Wielded a massive scythe-axe linked to necromantic energy. Ruled without emotion through death rituals. His core was destroyed by Lucifer; his body was never recovered.
- **Vulkran** (Fire District) — A knight of molten steel and volcanic power. His armor could melt sand into glass. Slain by Lucifer. His remains lie entombed in a fire-cracked canyon near Plodrough — still warm to this day.

**Lucifer** (#6 Arashi), wielding his unique power of Magic Cancellation, killed all four district leaders. The districts, robbed of their defining figures, collapsed into uneasy coexistence. Fodon is now a diverse metropolis marked by old ruins and fierce district pride.

## Other Settlements

- **Mayson** — Desert town. Many crypts beneath the town square — residents know not to excavate.
- **Plodrough** — Canyon town. An underground city carved vertically into the cliffside, districts stacked one above another.
- **Sloumont** — Dry plains farming town near a river. Small agricultural port providing basic food for the desert settlements.

## Government: The Dune Accord

Named after the pact signed at Ashglass Hall — built on the canyon where Vulkran died, its walls of black obsidian and lava glass still glowing with heat veins.

**Four High Seats** represent the former districts (Bug, Magic, Death, Fire). Each elected by its district population. Equal voting power.

**Voice of Sand** — a fifth seat elected by the entire kingdom every five years. Holds tie-breaking power, emergency authority, and international representation. Known as *"the Will of the Wastes."*

## Historical Alliance & War

Fodon allied with Frada in a massive war against the Ipadora Kingdom — driving Ipadora off the mainland and seizing former Ipadora territory. A manmade river was cut to divide Fodon from its defeated foe. The water control situation that followed has been economically disadvantageous for Fodon ever since.
