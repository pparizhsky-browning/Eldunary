## Capital & Settlements

- Suudon (Capital): City in the Golem Swamp, home of the Golem King. Not hostile but unfriendly to visitors. Shrouded in mist. Houses a vast underground network rumored to extend beneath the Great Lake. A secret underground city is rumored to exist below.
- Cridbury: Built into the foothills of the Jagged Mountains. Home to many Golems and miners. Famous for strong metal and rare minerals. Training center for heavy weapon users. Outsiders without a guide often get 'lost' in the tunnels.
- Klosdon: Forest rest stop in the middle of Nikolem. Golems live peacefully here. Few visitors, fewer rules. Known for strange glowing plants at night.
- Phaaross: Bridge city into Vacron. Strong Golem military presence. Stone wall facing Vacron. Watchtowers on all sides. Trade hub connecting northwest to northeast.

## Geography & Environment

Mostly mountainous terrain — steep, jagged cliffs and deep caverns. Some tunnels are rumored to reach the core of Eldunary. Swamps surround Suudon.

## Government & Politics

The Golem King resides in the largest, most isolated mountain. Difficult to reach due to natural defenses and elevation. The kingdom effectively operates under his will. Golems actively monitor the entire kingdom — acting as both sentries and enforcers.

## Magic & Technology

The kingdom is rich in rune magic. Known for their forges where rune users train, acquire Runestones, and craft infused gear.

## Infrastructure

Contains a vast underground tunnel network connecting the northernmost mountains to Suudon near the Great Lake.
