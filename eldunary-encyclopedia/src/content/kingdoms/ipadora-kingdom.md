summary: "Mostly underwater kingdom controlling all of Criozevan's waterways. Near-zero crime sanctuary above, vast fortress below."
---

*Every kingdom on Criozevan drinks from rivers Ipadora controls. Every ship sails through lanes Ipadora taxes. The kingdom was driven from the mainland centuries ago. It has been winning the peace ever since.*

The **Ipadora Kingdom** is mostly underwater — built in deep oceanic valleys, reef caverns, and pressurized grottos that no surface-dwelling race has ever mapped completely. Its surface presence is limited to a beachfront island and scattered coastal settlements, but surface presence is not where Ipadora's power lies. Its power lies in control: every waterway, every river, every sea lane on the continent flows through jurisdictions the kingdom monitors And taxes.

## Capital: Ipadora Sanctuary

**Ipadora Sanctuary** occupies the western face of an island — the only capital on Criozevan with near-zero crime. Not because enforcement is brutal (though it is thorough underwater), but because the culture of the Sanctuary doesn't provide environments where crime can easily take root: the above-ground city welcomes outsiders, refugees, and peaceful travelers with genuine hospitality; the underwater complex beneath is one of the most heavily secured locations in the world, accessible only through monitored passages.

The **Ipadora Palace** lies beneath the island in a heavily secured cavern — coral-reinforced, bioluminescent-lit, equipped with pressure-pulse defense systems that can disable any known underwater combat unit.

A faction of the Ipadora family also governs **Glaril**, the largest underwater city in Criozevan, off the coast of Akison.

## Strategic Position

After the war against Fodon and Frada, Ipadora lost mainland territory. In response, they cut a manmade river to physically separate their remaining mainland portion from rival kingdoms. The water tax system was then formalized and enforced more aggressively than before.

The result: every kingdom that lost a direct military fight against Ipadora still pays them tribute through water taxes. Of all the outcomes of that war, this is the one the Fodon-Frada alliance did not anticipate.

## Government & Culture

Matriarchal monarchy. **Queen Nayele of the Tide** rules through the **Ipadora Family** matriarchal line.

**Deep Mother** is worshiped — sea of memory, keeper of the drowned dead, source of all water. Temples are built into ocean trenches, accessible only underwater.

Values: flow, intuition, oceanic balance. Patience as a strategic tool. The kingdom is respected as seafarers and river-taxers; only when their patience is exhausted do they become genuinely dangerous.
