## Capital & Settlements

- Ipadora Sanctuary (Capital): Located on the western side of the Ipadora island. A true sanctuary — almost no crime. Welcomes outsiders, refugees, and peaceful travelers. Has both a surface island city and a vast underwater complex. The Ipadora Palace lies beneath the island in a heavily secured cavern. Entire capital is heavily patrolled, especially underwater.

## Geography & Environment

Kingdom is mostly underwater — built in deep oceanic valleys. Surface terrain includes beachfronts and lightly forested areas. A large manmade river separates its mainland portion from rival kingdoms. Underwater landscapes filled with coral structures, bioluminescent flora, and fortified trenches.

## Government & Politics

In ancient times, Ipadora controlled much more mainland territory. Lost land after a massive war against the Kingdoms of Fodon and Frada. After being driven back, Ipadora cut a river to physically and symbolically separate from its former enemies. Despite the loss, Ipadora maintains autonomy and military power through water control.

## Strategic Power

Controls all major rivers, sea lanes, and underwater trade routes across Criozevan. All kingdoms using waterways must pay taxes or gain permission from Ipadora — a monopoly that makes the kingdom economically and politically powerful.
