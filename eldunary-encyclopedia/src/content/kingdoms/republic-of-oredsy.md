## Capital & Settlements

- Oredsy (Capital, citizen name: Tharnselda — 'Sword's Choice'): Built around the central arena Fereltharn ('Justice's Blade'), used for duels, referendums, and civic votes. The Tower of Vaelrin houses the Circle Council and archives of national law. Run by Pegasus. Southern land trade hub. Kind of friendly to outsiders.
- Wrofast: Port town controlling the river-to-sea choke point. Creates ships and innovative maritime tech. All ships bear a metallic blue 'W' on the top-right of each sail and the bowsprit tip. Population speaks Sailor Speak, a separate language.
- Imuton: Forest town surrounded by grand trees. People live inside enormous tree trunks.
- Icogas: Ancient magic site under the town square. Magic is unstable inside town — rumored to be cursed. Holotech and runestones do not function here. Secret Butterfly monitoring station.
- Zhuiburn: Surrounded by perpetual flames. Extremely unfriendly to outsiders (rumors of being burned alive on entry). Population speaks Pyrrhith.

## Geography & Environment

Mountain-fed rivers cut through pine-lined ridges and windswept plains. Cities built in ring formations around central training yards or debate plazas. Trade roads guarded by rotating citizen patrols called Bladewards.

## Government — The Free Assembly

Made up of elected delegates from each region, chosen through open vote or challenge.
- The Circle: High mentors, former champions, senior arbiters of law.
- The Commons: Rotating citizen delegates serving fixed terms.

Major decisions may be overturned by popular duel or collective voice-vote in Tharnic.

## Leader — Selvarin, Master of Swords

Holds the lifelong title of Master of Swords and elected Voice of the Republic. Known as Kirel'dra Tharnic ('Speaker of the Sword's Truth'). Embodies the civic virtues of clarity, strength, and fairness. Mediates national disputes, leads the militia in wartime, sets training standards.

## Military — The Bladeguard

A trained citizen militia with martial schools in every city. Voluntary but expected — every adult citizen trained by age 14.
- Road Wards: Mounted defenders and scouts.
- Honor Guard: Elite duelists and civic protectors.
- Steel Chorus: Battlefield signalers trained in rhythm-based Tharnic calls.

Officers voted in by their units through ritual declaration.

## Culture & Society

Swordcraft is a foundational discipline tied to moral philosophy and civic law. All major disputes — property, leadership, even marriages — may be resolved by formal duel. Public debates held in Rings of Word and Will — rhetoric and restraint carry equal weight with steel. Festivals feature oath-readings, retellings of ancient duels, and open competitions. Foundational principles: 'Speak with clarity. Fight with purpose. Live with honor.' The Republic exists not to rule its people, but to be shaped by their skill, their speech, and their sword.

## Economy & Trade

Exports masterwork blades, armour, and steel. Markets operate under civic guild charters ratified by the Free Assembly. Contracts signed in both Common and formal Tharnic. Known for its binding contracts.

## Notable History

**Selvarin and the Golden War (795–800 ACC):** Before the Golden War, the territory that is now the Republic of Oredsy was a collection of small, independent entities with no unified government. Selvarin joined the Northern Goldhelm faction during the war — not out of political conviction, but because the Goldhelm Kingdom had been helping him forge a sword, and he honored that working relationship. When the war ended with the Equinox of Power, Selvarin founded the Republic of Oredsy by uniting those formerly independent territories under a single flag and the principles of the Free Assembly.

## Language — Tharnic

Sacred civic language of Oredsy. Built for clarity, strength, and moral alignment. Used in courts, military orders, and oaths. Spoken with firm tone and minimal ambiguity. Key terms: dael (honor/truth), loen (dishonor/challenge), tharn (sword/path/will), kirel (speak/declare), selda (choice/vote), ferel (law/justice). Sample phrases: 'Vaela selda dael.' (Freedom is the choice of the honorable.) | 'Kirel tharn loen.' (You declare the blade without honor.) | 'Morin vaela.' (Remember liberty.) Children learn Tharnic alongside sword forms.
