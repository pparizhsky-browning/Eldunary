*"Speak with clarity. Fight with purpose. Live with honor."* — the three foundational principles of Oredsy, taught to every child before formal education begins.

The **Republic of Oredsy** is the only nation in Criozevan where a sword is simultaneously a weapon, a legal instrument, and a philosophical text. Swordsmanship is not a military specialty — it is a civic discipline, taught to every adult by age fourteen and used to settle disputes that range from property boundaries to marriages. The blade is not violence; the blade is clarity made physical.

## Capital & Settlements

**Oredsy** (citizen name: *Tharnselda*, meaning *"Sword's Choice"*) is built around the central arena **Fereltharn** (*"Justice's Blade"*), used for duels, referendums, and civic votes. The **Tower of Vaelrin** houses the Circle Council and archives of national law. Controlled by **Pegasus**. Southern land trade hub.

**Wrofast** — Port controlling the river-to-sea choke point. Creates ships and maritime tech. All Wrofast ships bear a metallic blue *"W"* on the top-right of each sail and the bowsprit tip. Population speaks Sailor Speak.

**Imuton** — Forest town where residents literally live inside enormous tree trunks — carved and maintained with the same craft applied to blade-making.

**Icogas** — Ancient magic site beneath the town square. Magic is unstable — rumored to be cursed. Holotech and runestones don't function here. Secret **Butterfly** monitoring station. **Dark Paladin (#1 Arashi)** is located here.

**Zhuiburn** — Surrounded by perpetual flames. Extremely hostile to outsiders. Population speaks Pyrrhith. **Lucifer (#6 Arashi)** was born here.

## Government: The Free Assembly

**The Circle** — High mentors, former champions, and senior arbiters of law.  
**The Commons** — Rotating citizen delegates serving fixed terms.  
Major decisions may be overturned by popular duel or collective voice-vote in Tharnic.

**Selvarin, Master of Swords** holds the lifelong title and is elected Voice of the Republic. Known as *Kirel'dra Tharnic* (*"Speaker of the Sword's Truth"*). Mediates national disputes, leads the militia in wartime. His power is equal to Sunlee and Veles.

**Pegasus** controls or heavily influences all significant political decisions in the Republic — the nature of this control is not publicly disclosed.

## Military: The Bladeguard

Voluntary but socially expected — every adult trained by 14.

- **Road Wards** — Mounted defenders and scouts
- **Honor Guard** — Elite duelists and civic protectors
- **Steel Chorus** — Battlefield signalers trained in rhythm-based Tharnic calls

Officers voted in by their units through ritual declaration. Citizens are **Bladewards** between campaigns.

## Language: Tharnic

Sacred civic language. Key terms: *dael* (honor/truth), *loen* (dishonor/challenge), *tharn* (sword/path/will), *kirel* (speak/declare), *selda* (choice/vote), *ferel* (law/justice).

Sample phrases: *"Vaela selda dael"* (Freedom is the choice of the honorable). *"Morin vaela"* (Remember liberty).
