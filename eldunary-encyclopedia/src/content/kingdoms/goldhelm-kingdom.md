*Travelers who approach Ovodon by sea notice, before anything else, the silence. No magic hum, no arcane shimmer, no rune-glow on the fortifications. Just engineered perfection, silent and total.*

The **Goldhelm Kingdom** occupies the northwestern peninsula of Criozevan — a territory of lightly hilly terrain, sparse forests, and significant natural water barriers that the kingdom treats not as obstacles but as architecture. Every coastal inlet, every river crossing, every natural choke point has been militarized and maintained since the founding. The kingdom does not merely occupy its geography; it has weaponized it.

## Capital & Settlements

**Ovodon** is the political and military seat — a large city on the northeastern sub-peninsula, dominated by the *Gilded Cradle*: a towering castle of holo-gilded stone where the Goldhelm royal family resides and from which King Aldric commands. The Gilded Cradle is not merely a palace. It is an architectural statement: permanent, imposing, and hostile to outsiders in the same way a fortification is hostile to armies. Ovodon does not welcome visitors.

**Ibeson** is the scientific capital of Criozevan — a different kind of city entirely. Where Ovodon is martial grandeur, Ibeson is controlled precision: labs, foundries, research halls, and test ranges. Public laboratories are open to Goldhelm citizens with proper clearance. Secret underground facilities beneath the city conduct experiments the kingdom has not publicized and has actively denied. What is being built in those sublevels is unknown to anyone outside the government's inner council — though the creation of **Kaboom** and the employment of **Helm** suggest the experiments involve weaponized beings.

## Government & Politics

A monarchy with a council of advisors drawn from six sectors:
- *Scientific* — overseeing Ibeson and the research apparatus
- *Military* — the Auric Vanguard command
- *Maritime* — the Goldhelm Maritime Trade and Defense Corps (MTDC)
- *Merchants Guild* — the Imperial Merchants Guild managing domestic and Frada trade
- *Northern Criozevan Diplomat* — relations with Nikolem, Darkmane, and beyond
- *Southern Criozevan Diplomat* — relations with Vacron, Fodon, and beyond

Ideology: **Technocratic Isolationism**. The kingdom produces what it needs, trades only with the Republic of Frada, and regards every interaction with the outside world as a potential vector for corruption or infiltration.

## Military: The Auric Vanguard

Five divisions, Roman-formation combat doctrine:
- **Brutes** — Heavy frontline: holo-tech war axes, multi-layered holo-armor, holo-shields
- **Archers** — Light ranged: holo-tech bows, light holo-armor
- **Swordsmen** — Standard infantry: holo-tech swords
- **Spearmen** — Anti-cavalry and defensive formations
- **Medics** — Holotech-based field healing and support

Natural water barriers are exploited as primary defensive infrastructure. The Goldhelm MTDC controls naval approaches.

## Magic & Technology

Magic use is a *capital offense*. Public execution awaits any citizen or foreigner found practicing any form of magic within kingdom borders. The **Department of Holometric Advancement** advances holotech yearly, replacing new potential magic applications before citizens feel the absence.

**Holotech** encompasses: military weapons, armor, shields, transportation (hover-rails, bridge networks), medical devices, architectural lighting, and communication. The kingdom functions entirely without magic. This is a point of profound ideological pride.

## Economy & Trade

National economic goal: **autarky** (total self-sufficiency). The only exception is selective trade with Frada — research findings and advanced prototypes exchanged for Frada's military industrial output. The Imperial Merchants Guild regulates all transactions.

Infrastructure: hover-rails for rapid troop movement, stone roads maintained to military standard, and the most fortified bridge network in Criozevan.

## Culture

Elitist, hierarchical, obsessed with advancement. Citizens are ranked by what they contribute. Art exists but is secondary to utility. Religion — the Path of Radiant Order — functions as an ideological enforcement mechanism, reinforcing social compliance and opposition to magic as moral positions.

The Golden War (a civil conflict between Ovodon's north and Ibeson's south) is officially filed in the kingdom's historical records as a *"resolved administrative dispute."* Citizens are not encouraged to discuss it further.
