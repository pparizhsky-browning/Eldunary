## Capital & Settlements

- Ovodon (Capital): A large city on the northeastern peninsula, dominated by a towering castle dubbed the 'Gilded Cradle,' where the Goldhelm royal family resides. Not friendly to outsiders.
- Ibeson: Scientific capital of Criozevan. Hosts many public and private labs. Secret underground experimentation conducted by the Goldhelm government.

## Geography & Environment

Lightly hilly terrain with thin, sparse forests. Surrounded by ocean on most sides. A heavily fortified river divides the kingdom: Ovodon to the north, Ibeson to the south. Isolated from the rest of the continent by natural water barriers and controlled crossings.

## Government & Politics

Monarchy with a council of advisors from each sector: Scientific, Military, Maritime, Merchants Guild, Northern Criozevan Diplomat, and Southern Criozevan Diplomat. Currently ruled by King Aldric. Ideology: Technocratic Isolationism.

## Military

- Brutes: Heavy frontline fighters — holo-tech war axes, multi-layered holo-armor, holo-shields.
- Archers: Ranged units — holo-tech bows and arrows, light holo-armor.
- Swordsmen: Standard infantry — holo-tech swords and armor.
- Spearmen: Anti-cavalry and defensive — holo-tech spears and shields.
- Medics: Healers using holotech-based support systems.

Attack style mirrors Roman army formations. Uses natural water barriers and tech for defense.

## Magic & Technology

Magic is completely banned inside the kingdom. Use is punishable by public execution. Holotech is used in place of magic for everyday life, warfare, and industry.

## Economy & Trade

Autarky (self-sufficiency) is the national economic goal. All trade is restricted except with the Republic of Frada. Exports scientific findings and research exclusively to Frada. Infrastructure: Hover-rails, stone roads, and bridge networks.

## Culture & Society

Highly elitist. Citizens are obsessed with rising through the social hierarchy. Deeply isolationist — outsiders are viewed as lesser beings. Holidays include Holo-tech Day (celebrating the invention of holotech) and Founding Day (commemorating the establishment of the kingdom in Ovodon).

## Key Organizations

- Department of Holometric Advancement — scientific arm of the government.
- The Auric Vanguard — Goldhelm's military force.
- Goldhelm Maritime Trade and Defense Corps (MTDC) — controls rivers and seas, regulates trade.
- Imperial Merchants Guild — government-run guild for regulated trade inside Goldhelm and Frada.

## Notable History

The Golden War: A civil war fought between the North and South of the kingdom.
