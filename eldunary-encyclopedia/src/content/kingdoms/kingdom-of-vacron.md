summary: "Largest city on the continent at its center. Strict law, diverse population. Crimson Rooks HQ. Continental trade nexus."
---

*Vacron is the city that holds Criozevan together. Whether the continent deserves to be held together is an open philosophical question that Vacron does not have time for.*

The **Kingdom of Vacron** occupies the geographic center of Criozevan, built around river valleys that form the continent's natural crossroads. Every major trade route — north-south, east-west — passes through Vacron's jurisdiction. This position gives it political leverage that its otherwise unremarkable government should not possess, and Vacron exploits this leverage with considerable sophistication.

## Capital & Settlements

**Vacron** (Capital) is the largest city on the entire continent, sitting at the geographic center of Criozevan. It is the hub for all commerce, a meeting point for every race, and the home of the **Crimson Rooks HQ** — the organization tasked with maintaining world order. The Crimson Knight, Criozevan's second most powerful being, resides here. Law is strict and punishments efficient. Outsiders are welcome, but the enforcers are watching, and the laws apply to everyone equally regardless of race, power, or affiliation.

**Clocester** is a former mining colony located at a continental tunnel intersection — connecting the Kingdom of Fodon (KoF), Republic of Frada (RoF), and Kingdom of Iyhago (KoI). Crystal caverns beneath the city are beautiful in the way unstable geology is beautiful: worth seeing, possible to die in at any moment (frequent collapses from underground duels). Mixed population of refugees and runaways. A neutral forge operates here under Rose protection. Criminal meeting ground.

**Klanron** sits on a peninsula between two rivers — the HQ of the **Butterfly** organization, and the designated meeting point for all Magic Societies of Criozevan. Its population is approximately 90% magic users. Friendly to visitors who are just visiting; changes attitude rapidly toward non-magic users who attempt to stay permanently.

**Anehull** was once a ghost town after an Arashi campaign leveled it. It was rebuilt into a resort — war relic tourism proved profitable. Rose leadership uses it for covert meetings. The Crimson Rooks maintain constant surveillance. Magic dampeners are active at all times, making it the only location in Vacron where magic cannot be used. Rumors of hell malefici sightings have not been confirmed or denied.

## Government & Trade

Highly diverse population. Strict legal code with harsh, efficient punishment for lawbreakers of any status. The kingdom's position as the continental economic heart means its laws are the de facto standard for international trade agreements. Friendly to outsiders — the law is the law, and if you follow it, Vacron is one of the most comfortable places in Criozevan.

## Key Organizations Present

- **Crimson Rooks** (HQ in Vacron) — world-order enforcement
- **Rose** (covert meetings in Anehull) — anti-Pegasus crime syndicate
- **Butterfly** (HQ in Klanron) — meta-power vigilante organization
- **Magic Societies** (meeting point in Klanron) — the collective magic governance councils
