## Capital & Settlements

- Frada (Capital): Administrative and command core of the republic. Built around the Glass Bastion citadel (a transparent dome of reinforced crystal that reflects spells and projectiles). Grid-like road layout for strategic movement and quick lockdowns. Factories, barracks, and research hubs form concentric layers around the central command tower. Civilians live in standardized housing zones under curfews and sector codes. Large central plaza used for military parades, oath ceremonies, and execution drills. Diverse but weak government. Medium crime. Doesn't prioritize outsiders.
- Hiypolis (Military City): One of the most fortified cities in Eldunary. Houses the Fradan War College, Republic Armory, and Holo-Tech Forge Docks. Divided into training zones, living blocks, and the Foundry Belt (a district of tech labs and gear manufactories). Built along a riverbank between the sea and a shielded inland base. In wartime, the entire city can transform into a mobile supply fortress via rail barge and sky towers. Closest non-desert city to Ipadora Sanctuary. Direct connection to Ipadora Kingdom. Produces custom holo-tech weaponry for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

## Geography & Environment

Dominated by dry plains, wind-cut ridges, and wide strategic rivers. Largely flat — military outposts easily redeployed via rail or hover convoys. Borders the sea with key access to international shipping lanes. Riverbanks are used for both training fields and logistics stations.

## Government — The Bronze Chain

Frada is governed by The Bronze Chain — a dual body government rooted in military merit.

- The Senate (26 members): Elected by citizen-vote from each province or army division. Debates economic laws, foreign alliances, and resource allotment. Every senator must serve at least 5 years in the armed forces before eligibility.
- The Command Council (9 generals): Active military officers elected by senior war veterans. Handles defense policy, emergency declarations, and war tech contracts.

Final decisions require both sides. If martial law is declared, the Command Council rules unilaterally.

## Military

Universal military service — every citizen must serve at least 3 years. Motto: 'Strength is the Spine of State.'
- Shield Corps: Heavy infantry — holo-shield formations and breach tactics.
- Striker Units: Elite recon and assault — adaptive holo-stealth systems.
- Sky Darts: Air division — hover-tech, drop deployment, scout gliders.
- Black Cloaks: Internal watchdogs and border enforcers trained in suppression and purge. Hunt deserters ('Broken Links') until eliminated.
- Forge Guard: Tech-specialists — holo-tech weapons, AI-linked armor, mech support.

Known for their discipline, tactical coordination, and zero tolerance for desertion.

## Economy & Trade

Holo-tech weapons are Frada's primary national export — ranging from energy blades to battlefield vision suites. Produces custom holo-tech for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

## Culture & Society

Praises utility, loyalty, and sacrifice. Civilian life revolves around work assignments, fitness tests, and loyalty rituals. Art and religion are seen as optional luxuries, often reserved for retired veterans or high-ranking officers. Annual 'March of Flame' commemorates the invention of holotech. National motto inscribed at every city gate: 'Fall in Line. Or Fall.'

## Notable Infrastructure

- The Glass Bastion: Transparent dome of reinforced crystal surrounding the Senate; reflects incoming spells or projectiles.
- The Foundry Belt: Industrial district where holo-tech blueprints are updated daily and combat suits are pressure-forged.
- The Spine Track: Super-long stone pathway between Frada and Hiypolis, used for honor marches, war games, and public exile.
