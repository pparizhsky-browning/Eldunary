## Capital & Settlements

- Frada (Capital): Administrative and command core of the republic. Built around the Glass Bastion citadel (a transparent dome of reinforced crystal that reflects spells and projectiles). Grid-like road layout for strategic movement and quick lockdowns. Factories, barracks, and research hubs form concentric layers around the central command tower. Civilians live in standardized housing zones under curfews and sector codes. Large central plaza used for military parades, oath ceremonies, and execution drills. Diverse but weak government. Medium crime. Doesn't prioritize outsiders.
- Hiypolis (Military City): One of the most fortified cities in Eldunary. Houses the Fradan War College, Republic Armory, and Holo-Tech Forge Docks. Divided into training zones, living blocks, and the Foundry Belt (a district of tech labs and gear manufactories). Built along a riverbank between the sea and a shielded inland base. In wartime, the entire city can transform into a mobile supply fortress via rail barge and sky towers. Closest non-desert city to Ipadora Sanctuary. Direct connection to Ipadora Kingdom. Produces custom holo-tech weaponry for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

## Geography & Environment

Dominated by dry plains, wind-cut ridges, and wide strategic rivers. Largely flat — military outposts easily redeployed via rail or hover convoys. Borders the sea with key access to international shipping lanes. Riverbanks are used for both training fields and logistics stations.

## Government — The Bronze Chain

Frada is governed by The Bronze Chain — a dual body government rooted in military merit.

- The Senate (26 members): Elected by citizen-vote from each province or army division. Debates economic laws, foreign alliances, and resource allotment. Every senator must serve at least 5 years in the armed forces before eligibility.
- The Command Council (9 generals): Active military officers elected by senior war veterans. Handles defense policy, emergency declarations, and war tech contracts.

Final decisions require both sides. If martial law is declared, the Command Council rules unilaterally.

## Military

Universal military service — every citizen must serve at least 3 years. Motto: 'Strength is the Spine of State.'
- Shield Corps: Heavy infantry — holo-shield formations and breach tactics.
- Striker Units: Elite recon and assault — adaptive holo-stealth systems.
- Sky Darts: Air division — hover-tech, drop deployment, scout gliders.
- Black Cloaks: Internal watchdogs and border enforcers trained in suppression and purge. Hunt deserters ('Broken Links') until eliminated.
- Forge Guard: Tech-specialists — holo-tech weapons, AI-linked armor, mech support.

Known for their discipline, tactical coordination, and zero tolerance for desertion.

## Economy & Trade

Holo-tech weapons are Frada's primary national export — ranging from energy blades to battlefield vision suites. Produces custom holo-tech for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

## Culture & Society

Praises utility, loyalty, and sacrifice. Civilian life revolves around work assignments, fitness tests, and loyalty rituals. Art and religion are seen as optional luxuries, often reserved for retired veterans or high-ranking officers. Annual 'March of Flame' commemorates the invention of holotech. National motto inscribed at every city gate: 'Fall in Line. Or Fall.'

## Notable Infrastructure

- The Glass Bastion: Transparent dome of reinforced crystal surrounding the Senate; reflects incoming spells or projectiles.
- The Foundry Belt: Industrial district where holo-tech blueprints are updated daily and combat suits are pressure-forged.
- The Spine Track: Super-long stone pathway between Frada and Hiypolis, used for honor marches, war games, and public exile.

## Founding History *(715 ACC)*

The Republic of Frada was not founded through popular revolution or gradual political consolidation. It was the deliberate creation of a single individual: the man later known as the **Dark Paladin**, who at the time of Frada's founding was known as the **Azure Paladin** — a Folkwynd warrior born in Vacron in 692, childhood companion of the man who would become the Crimson Knight.

The two had grown up together in the same district of Vacron, training and sparring through adolescence. Both wanted to change the world. In 712, the Crimson Knight's answer to that desire was the founding of the Crimson Rooks — peacekeeping through diplomacy, consent, and the cultivation of trust. The Azure Paladin's answer was different. He believed the continent's violence and disorder could only be ended through unification under a single governing authority. Where the Crimson Knight sought to bring kingdoms into conversation, the Azure Paladin intended to bring them to heel.

In 715 ACC, he founded the Republic of Frada — the military republic structure, the universal service mandate, and the Bronze Chain governing system — with an explicit long-term goal of continental conquest in the name of peace. He was not wrong about the disorder of the continent. He was wrong about the remedy.

Frada's early military campaigns were successful. By **730 ACC**, the republic had conquered the **Eshar-Thi** — a small union nation occupying the territory around Uyrand and Andport, which at the time had not yet come under Iyhago's governance.

In **732 ACC**, Fluffy gifted the Crimson Knight the indestructible crimson blazer — a public recognition of the Rooks' peacekeeping work. The Azure Paladin, who had spent seventeen years fighting wars he framed as necessary, watched his childhood friend receive a gift from the most powerful being in the world for choosing a different path. The Crimson Knight had asked him to stop, repeatedly, and he had not listened. The blazer was the moment something in him broke toward a different kind of answer. He turned to dark magic — not as a last resort but as a statement. He gave himself power beyond what any mortal had a right to and, in doing so, put himself permanently beyond the path he and the Crimson Knight had once walked together.

The Republic of Frada outlasted him. After his departure from its governance, Frada evolved from a conquest-oriented military state into the military republic it is today — still disciplined, still militarized, still organized around the structures he built, but no longer pursuing his original goal. The Azure Paladin's founding ideology was not preserved in Frada's institutional memory; it was buried under the practical needs of a state that had to govern what it already controlled. What remained was the architecture without the intent.

The Azure Paladin became the **Dark Paladin**. He eventually joined the Arashi as its #1 ranked active member. He has not aged since his corruption.
