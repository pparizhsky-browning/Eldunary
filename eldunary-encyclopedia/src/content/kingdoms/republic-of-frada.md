*"Fall in Line. Or Fall."* — inscribed at every city gate in the Republic of Frada.

The **Republic of Frada** is the most militarized functional democracy in Criozevan: a republic where every law has a military precedent, every civic title has a military equivalent, and children dream not of a career but of *which division* they will serve. It is not a totalitarian state — citizens vote, debate, and protest — but the presumption underlying all of it is that the Republic's strength is the Republic's virtue, and strength is measured in steel, discipline, and holotech output.

## Capital & Settlements

**Frada** (Capital) is built around the **Glass Bastion** — a transparent dome of reinforced crystal that serves as the Senate chamber and physically reflects incoming spells and projectiles. Grid-like roads allow rapid military lockdowns. Diverse population, weak civilian government, medium crime. Doesn't prioritize outsiders.

**Hiypolis** (Military City) is one of the most fortified cities in Criozevan. Houses the Fradan War College, Republic Armory, and Holo-Tech Forge Docks. Divided into training zones, living zones, and the Foundry Belt. In wartime, the entire city can transform into a mobile supply fortress via rail barge and sky towers. It sits uniquely close to the **Ipadora Sanctuary** — the only non-desert city with direct connection to the Ipadora Kingdom.

## Government: The Bronze Chain

**The Senate** (26 members): Elected by citizen-vote from each province or army division. Every senator must have served at least 5 years in the armed forces before eligibility.

**The Command Council** (9 generals): Active military officers elected by senior war veterans. Handles defense policy and emergency declarations.

Final decisions require both sides. Martial law gives the Command Council unilateral authority.

## Military

Universal military service: every citizen serves **at least 3 years**.

- **Shield Corps** — Heavy infantry, holo-shield breach tactics
- **Striker Units** — Elite adaptive holo-stealth recon and assault
- **Sky Darts** — Air division: hover-tech, drop deployment, scout gliders
- **Black Cloaks** — Internal watchdogs; hunt deserters (*"Broken Links"*) until eliminated
- **Forge Guard** — Tech-specialists: AI-linked armor, holo weapons, mech support

## Economy & Holotech

Holo-tech weapons are Frada's primary national export: energy blades, battlefield vision suites, custom gear for the Goldhelm Kingdom, Oredsy, and Pegasus-aligned factions. The **Foundry Belt** updates blueprints daily and pressure-forges combat suits.

The relationship with the Goldhelm Kingdom (exclusive trade partnership) gives both nations significant advantages: Goldhelm gets Frada's military output; Frada gets Goldhelm's scientific research.

## Culture

Utility, loyalty, sacrifice. Art is an optional luxury for retired veterans. The **March of Flame** commemorates holotech's invention annually. **The Spine Track** — a long stone pathway between Frada and Hiypolis — serves as the site for honor marches, war games, and public exile.
