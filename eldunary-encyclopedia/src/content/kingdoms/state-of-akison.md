*The Iron Path does not describe a road. It describes a decision made every moment: to choose discipline over impulse, presence over escape, clarity over comfort. Sunlee governs from this principle, and the State of Akison is shaped by it.*

The **State of Akison** is split between two geographical environments that seem as unlike each other as possible: a dense, ancient jungle on the mainland, and a serene, architecturally precise island city that blooms from the water like a stone flower. The contrast is not accidental — the tension between the jungle's primordial complexity and the island's cultivated order mirrors the doctrine of the Iron Path that governs both.

## Capital: Akison Island

**Akison** (Island Capital) encompasses its entire island — every square foot has been built on and shaped. The design is based on an ancient Japanese city pattern: curved rooftops, zen courtyards, fortified bamboo walls reinforced with stone, walkways spanning water between districts. The city expands from a central palace in the pattern of five cherry blossom petals: *the Five Blossom Rings (Sakura-go)*.

*The Five Blossom Rings:*
- **Tetsukaku** (鉄閣, *"Iron Heights"*) — Government district. Home to the Iron Bloom (Sunlee's palace and Tetsugan meeting hall). Stone watchtowers, ceremonial halls.
- **Koganemura** (黄金村, *"Golden Village"*) — Martial training district: temples, dojos, tournament grounds. Annual martial festivals, public spar duels.
- **Uramizu** (裏水, *"Hidden Waters"*) — Canal-filled black market zone. Curved alleys, shadow bridges, hidden gates. Policed unofficially by old guilds and smugglers.
- **Harashima** (原島, *"Sprawling Isle"*) — Riverfront economic district: foreign embassies, trader towers, floating market barges, midnight auctions.
- **Shōmeika** (照明花, *"Luminous Blossom"*) — Cultural and spiritual heart: blossom-viewing temples, ink halls, ancestral gardens. Paper lanterns, spirit drums, performance arenas.

The **Kurashiki Region** (Northern Island Mountains) is dense with sacred shrines and cherry blossom groves. Home to powerful samurai and shinobi clans with conditional loyalty to the Iron Path.

## Mainland Settlements

- **Oniofast** — Jungle town in ancient shifting ruins. **Pegasus covert operations HQ**. Half-mechanical, half-organic streets. Rose, Butterfly, and all magic users banned — entry is suicide. Annual *"Signal Harvest"* event.
- **Kusamori** — Center of medicine, poison, and herbs. Platform-built above the forest canopy. Tram transportation.
- **Okbridge** — Checkpoint connecting mainland to Akison island. Tight customs, engineer guilds, vehicle refit stations.
- **Neruvalis** — *"The Disappearing City"* — built on a slope into the water, sometimes submerged by tides. Midway port to Glaril.

## Government: The Iron Path

**Sunlee**, Master of Martial Arts, governs through personal strength, respect, and the doctrine of discipline and clarity. He never speaks more than necessary. He carries only the **Black Root** — a metalwood staff from the old jungle. No armor, no magic.

**The Tetsugan** (*"Iron Eye Council"*): 4 Kurashiki Clan Emissaries, 5 City Keepers, and 2 Tora no Shūjin (*"Prison Tigers"*). Meets in the Iron Bloom. Sunlee's silence overrides any tie.

## Military: Blades of the Iron Path

- **Tetsu-no-Kiba** (*"Iron Fangs"*) — Urban enforcers
- **Yamigasa** (*"Shadow Hats"*) — Ninja operatives from Kurashiki
- **Kinzoku Kawa** (*"Metal River"*) — Amphibious soldiers
- **Sōryū Heika** (*"Twin Dragon Guards"*) — Sunlee's personal protectors

Military entry requires surviving the **Tetsudōmei** (*"Iron Oath"*): a week-long silent jungle trial.
