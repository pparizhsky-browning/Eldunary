*There is no throne in the Warring Darkmane Realm. There never has been, not truly — every time someone builds one, someone else burns it down.*

The **Warring Darkmane Realm** is not a kingdom in any functional sense. It is a geographic region and an ethnic identity, held together by nothing stronger than the fact that the Darkmane Elves who inhabit its ancient forests have nowhere else they would rather not be. Its dense, ancient trees carry the evidence of generations of internal combat — corrupted rune scars, collapsed pockets of black-magic-scorched earth, ruins that no one bothered to rebuild because the next battle would only ruin them again.

## Capital & Settlements

**Grousea** carries the label of *de facto capital* because it is the largest permanent settlement and the center of criminal activity for the northwestern forest region. It has no formal status as a capital because there is no formal government to confer that status. It is shady and extremely dangerous — a place where information brokers work next door to poison merchants, and the alley behind every building leads to something best not investigated.

**Vlurg** is the black market capital — a town built around its central market square, where items that cannot be bought anywhere else in Criozevan appear and disappear based on the political tides of the criminal networks that supply it. Dark elves in Vlurg speak Nualthyr when they do not want to be understood, which is most of the time.

**Wrediff** is a training ground so hidden that most outsiders are not sure it exists. Shielded by dark elf magic that actively confuses the navigation of approaching strangers. No markets, no trade, no commerce — only forges, shrines where ancestral spirits are consulted, and poison-makers working in silence. The locals speak only Nualthyr.

**Adlens** stands apart from everything described above. It is genuinely peaceful — home to dark elves who have rejected violence, Golems who defected from the Golem King's service, and Goldhelms who fled the corruption of their own kingdom. A large port makes it a trade hub connecting the Goldhelm Kingdom to the southeast by boat. A peace treaty was once signed in Adlens, and somehow it has been honored. The Ace organization enforces rules here, hired by the local government.

## Geography

Ancient forest. The trees are old enough that their root systems have grown into the ruins of structures from before the realm existed. Navigation is deliberately difficult — the elves maintain trails that only make sense if you know the system. Corrupted runes are scattered in the deep interior, left by the Golem King and long since destabilized. They pulse with dark magic that can infect the mind, and they explode at unpredictable intervals.

The elven warfare of centuries past has scarred the landscape more permanently than any single battle could. Areas of the forest are still toxic from concentrated poison use, generations of corpses decomposing in ways that weren't natural, and the residue of dark magic that simply never dissipated.

## The Darkmane Family & The Fallen

The family that once gave this realm its name is broken. Internal corruption — the kind that happens when power is concentrating and no one is watching the people holding it — transformed some family members into *The Fallen*: dark-magic-possessed husks that retained physical form but lost all selfhood. When the remaining family exiled The Fallen, the structure that had held tribal relationships in approximate balance collapsed.

Legend says The Fallen still inhabit the deepest forest. Travelers lost among the old trees are said to be claimed by them.

## Government (or Its Absence)

Warring tribes and villages. Each one operates by its own rules, its own combination of elder authority, trial-by-duel, and whatever pragmatic arrangements have emerged from surviving coalitions. There is no national military, no shared currency, no common law. The Arashi have approached some clan leaders; the Butterfly organization monitors certain locations; independent criminal groups operate without paying tribute to any formal power.

This is either the most free society in Criozevan or the most dangerous, depending on who you are and how well you can fight.
