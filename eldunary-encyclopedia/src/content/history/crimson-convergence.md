The **Crimson Convergence** is the event that historians use as the dividing line between Criozevan's period of contested multi-faction instability and its current relative equilibrium — *relative* being the accurate modifier, because nothing that followed was peaceful, but the post-Convergence order has proven more stable than the thirty years that preceded it.

In those thirty years, the faction structures that had emerged from the **Golden War's** aftermath collapsed sequentially: trade alliances failed when key signatories were replaced, military agreements dissolved when the powers that had signed them restructured, and the political architecture that had been built on agreed-upon mutual recognition was undermined by new actors who had not been party to the original agreements. The center of the continent — what is now the Kingdom of Vacron — became a vacuum of authority where every faction with territorial ambition was simultaneously moving.

The **Crimson Knight** resolved this not through military campaign in the conventional sense but through a series of demonstrations that made the cost-benefit calculation for opposing him uniformly negative across every faction that attempted the calculation. The exact methods are not fully documented — the Crimson Rooks' records from this period are controlled — but the outcomes are: every faction that had been moving into the vacuum either withdrew voluntarily, ceased to exist as a functioning entity, or formalized into the organizational structure that still exists.

**Rose** was founded in the Convergence's aftermath precisely because the absence of a neutral intermediary had been so visibly catastrophic. The founding members included representatives from three factions that had been opposing each other the week before, who shared the assessment that a repeat was unacceptable. Their first act was establishing the Uyrand headquarters in neutral territory and beginning the diplomatic infrastructure that has prevented the seven subsequent crises from escalating to Convergence scale.
