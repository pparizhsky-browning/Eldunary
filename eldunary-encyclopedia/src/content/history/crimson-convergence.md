The **Crimson Convergence** is the defining cosmological event of Eldunary — the moment from which all years are measured (ACC = After Crimson Convergence).

- A red star appeared in the sky over Eldunary for exactly 40 days.
- The star drew magic out of the earth and condensed it into tangible forms — primarily runes.
- The light caused millions of years of evolution to occur in just 40 days, radically altering all species.
- Humans evolved into Folkwynd.
- The light was lethal to Elves. Every elf it touched died instantly. Surviving elves retreated into the thick forests beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains. Over generations they evolved into the Darkmane Elves. This region is now known as the Warring Darkmane Realm.
- Magic flooded from the earth into the mountains, awakening the Golem King from millions of years of slumber. Both the Golem King and Fluffy had existed since the Dragon Era, long before the Convergence — it did not create them. The Convergence awakened the Golem King from his ancient dormancy deep within the Jagged Mountains. Fluffy's reawakening, if it occurred at the same time, was not publicly observed.
- Humans in certain distinct climates evolved differently from the Folkwynd baseline — giving rise to the Tharnex, Ipadoras, and Shar'kai.
- When the star finally vanished, the new calendar began. All subsequent years are counted from this moment.

All maps of Criozevan are dated to Year 1000 ACC.
