In Year 957, a significant earthquake rattled the northern half of the continent without any geological precedent or warning. The event was felt from the Jagged Mountains to Fodon and as far east as Akison's mainland coast. No buildings collapsed, but the tremors lasted long enough — and were strange enough in character, felt as a single sustained shudder rather than a series of shocks — that the event was recorded as anomalous in archives across multiple kingdoms.

At the peak of the tremors, Fluffy was sighted floating above the northern face of the Jagged Mountains — stationary, visible for approximately three minutes, and then gone. Witnesses in Cridbury and the surrounding Nikolem foothills observed it directly. No explanation for the earthquake was ever established. No explanation for Fluffy's presence was offered. The Golem King, who resides within those mountains, has not commented. The Crimson Rooks' formal report on the event lists the earthquake as "unresolved — natural cause unconfirmed" and Fluffy's appearance as "consistent with prior sighting patterns — no engagement with observers, no communication, no intervention."

The earthquake has never recurred. The northern Jagged Mountains show no structural evidence of what caused it.
