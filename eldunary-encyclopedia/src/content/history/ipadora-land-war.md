summary: "c. 900 ACC. A war triggered when a criminal in Ipadora territory killed a Fodon Bug District Tharnex. Fodon and Frada drove Ipadora off the mainland. Ipadora's military — built for sea combat — was ill-suited for land defence. The manmade river dividing the territories remains as a permanent monument to the conflict."

## Background

By **Year 900 ACC**, the **Ipadora Kingdom** had completed its long campaign to control all of eastern Fodon up to the river bordering Frada — the largest territorial expansion in the kingdom's history. From this position, Ipadora began aggressively taxing both Frada and Fodon for access to the waterways adjacent to Ipadora-controlled territory, as well as for land passage rights across their expanded borders. The fees grew increasingly punitive over the following years.

## The Trigger

As Ipadora continued pushing its expansion toward Fodon city, a criminal in Ipadora territory killed a **Tharnex** belonging to Fodon's Bug District. The Fodon leadership interpreted the killing as a deliberate act of aggression — a signal that Ipadora was escalating toward open war. They declared war on Ipadora.

## The Conflict

The war exposed the fundamental weakness of Ipadora's military doctrine: their army is built for sea and underwater combat, not land warfare. Against a two-front conflict — **Frada's** rigid, disciplined army pressing from one direction, and **Fodon's** massive and ethnically diverse population pressing from another — Ipadora was unable to defend its vast inland border effectively. The kingdom lost a significant portion of its most resource-rich inland towns and the shoreline access that accompanied them.

In response, Ipadora's military engineers **deliberately constructed a new river** as a strategic defensive boundary — designed to give the kingdom a natural underwater chokepoint that could be defended from below. This manmade river became the formal dividing line between Ipadora's remaining territory and its former holdings.

## Aftermath

The towns Ipadora lost were absorbed into Fodon. Small numbers of Ipadoras remain scattered through those settlements, but they are a minority and largely isolated from the main kingdom.

Ipadora retained its island sanctuary, its control of all major sea lanes, and its water-taxation system — meaning it lost territory but not economic power. The kingdom remains one of the most strategically vital forces on the continent.
