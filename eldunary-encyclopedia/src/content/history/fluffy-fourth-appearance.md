summary: "During the Fradan re-occupation of Ipadoran territory (901 ACC), Fluffy appeared above one of the burning settlements. It did not prevent the atrocities. But in that settlement, in that hour, the killing paused. Fluffy left. The account was suppressed by Fradan command. It survives in Ipadoran oral tradition with complicated bitterness: Fluffy came, and then it left."

Following the Ipadora Land War, in the year 901, as Frada's forces completed the re-occupation of former Ipadora-held inland territory, the transition was not clean. The Fradan military, operating far from its institutional constraints and in territory that had recently been enemy ground, committed a series of organized atrocities against the Ipadoran civilian population remaining in the reclaimed towns — killings, mass violence, and the systematic destruction of Ipadoran settlements and cultural sites. The Ipadoran civilians who could not retreat had no defense.

Fluffy appeared above one of the burning settlements. A single appearance, brief, above a specific location. It did not prevent the atrocities. It did not intervene. But it was seen, and the soldiers who saw it stopped. Not all of them. Not immediately. But in that settlement, in that hour, the killing paused. Fluffy left. The account was suppressed by Fradan military command and does not appear in any official Fradan record of the war. It survives in Ipadoran oral tradition, where it is recorded not with reverence but with a complicated bitterness: Fluffy came, and then it left, and the war was what it was.

This appearance produced the deepest division in how magic users across the continent interpret Fluffy's non-interventionism. The debate has never been resolved.
