Nebbio had been born into the family and rejected as too weak in childhood. He returned with power the family had no framework to understand. Wrofast has had no formal noble leadership since."

In **993 ACC**, every member of **the Mist family** was killed in a single night by **Nebbio** — the individual who would later take the rank of #3 in the Arashi organization.

## The Mist Family

The Mist family were a Folkwynd noble line who served for generations as the de facto ruling family of Wrofast, holding the town's informal leadership through a combination of maritime wealth, local authority, and institutional presence in the port's commercial and legal systems. They were not a royal family in any formal sense, but in Wrofast's practical governance, the head of the Mist family was the closest thing the town had to a ruler.

## The Event

Nebbio had been born into the family and rejected as too weak in childhood, departing Wrofast under humiliating circumstances to seek power elsewhere. He returned years later having become something the family had no framework to understand. He began with his father — the family's head — and continued through the household until no one was left.

The Wrofast town records list the event as an unsolved multiple homicide. The Crimson Rooks investigated and concluded the killings were carried out by a single individual with mist-based abilities. No arrest was made.

## Aftermath

No subsequent attempt to reconstitute the Mist family as a governing body was organized, and Wrofast has operated without formal noble leadership since. The town's maritime guild structure filled the vacuum over the following years.

Nebbio did not stay to govern what he had cleared. He had no interest in Wrofast. He wanted the family to know, at the end, that the child they rejected had come back.
