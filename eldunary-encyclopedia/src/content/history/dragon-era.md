summary: "The era before the Crimson Convergence, when dragons dominated Eldunary. Ended when a mysterious entity known as The Shadow exterminated every dragon — except Zunarorth, the sole survivor."
---

Long before the Crimson Convergence — thousands of years before the calendar began — the world of Eldunary was dominated by dragons. These were not mindless beasts but powerful, intelligent creatures with deep awareness of the world around them. However, they were solitary by nature. They built no cities, formed no governments, and left behind no written records. Each dragon carved out vast territories across the continents, and their presence alone shaped the landscape — scorching valleys, hollowing mountains, and splitting coastlines.

During this era, two primordial beings also existed: the entity later known as **Fluffy** and the being who would become the **Golem King**. Both are believed to have been born or created around the same time as the dragons themselves, at or near the very origin of Eldunary. Their exact nature and relationship during this period is unknown, but they are said to have known each other for all of time. Both entered a state of dormancy long before the Crimson Convergence — the Golem King sleeping deep within what would become the Jagged Mountains, and Fluffy withdrawing from the physical world entirely.

The Dragon Era ended not through natural decline but through annihilation. A mysterious entity known only as **The Shadow** appeared without warning and systematically hunted and killed every dragon on the planet. The Shadow's origin remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in Eldunary — theories range from an invasion by a more advanced civilization on a distant continent to an incursion from another dimension entirely. What is known is that The Shadow was powerful enough to destroy beings that had ruled unchallenged for millennia, and that after completing its slaughter, it vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. It has never been seen again.

Only one dragon survived: **Zunarorth**, who managed to escape and hide from The Shadow. His survival and the circumstances of his escape remain unknown to all but himself. The extinction of the dragons left an enormous power vacuum in the world — one that would not be filled until the Crimson Convergence reshaped all life on Eldunary thousands of years later.
