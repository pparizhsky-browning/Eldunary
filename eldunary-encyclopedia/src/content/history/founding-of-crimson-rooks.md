The **Crimson Rooks** were founded in **Year 712 ACC**, at the same time as the formal establishment of the **Kingdom of Vacron** as a centralized state. The two institutions are inseparable from their origins — they grew together from their earliest days and remain deeply intertwined.

The organization grew slowly over the following centuries, accumulating influence, political capital, and reach across every kingdom on the continent. By **Year 1000**, they had become the closest thing to a neutral peacekeeping authority in Criozevan — neither a government nor an army, but an institution capable of operating in the space between both.

Their headquarters remains in Vacron, the largest and most centrally located city on the continent.
