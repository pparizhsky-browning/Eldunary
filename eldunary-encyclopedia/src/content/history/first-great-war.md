The **First Great War** is so old that its direct documentation exists only in three forms: archaeological evidence, the institutional memories of beings old enough to have been present (the Golem King and Velho are the two confirmed surviving participants with cognitive continuity from the period), and the records that Pegasus maintains in its historical archive — the most complete written account available, which is still fragmentary.

What is established from convergent sources: the war involved every major racial group then present in Criozevan in competing territorial claims, lasted for a period measured in decades rather than years, and ended not through decisive military conclusion but through exhaustion, population attrition, and the recognition by surviving parties that continued engagement produced no achievable gains. The Golem King describes it in the one documented account he has given as *the war that taught everyone what they could survive and what they couldn't, and most things couldn't survive most of it.*

The **territorial structure** that preceded all current maps was established in the war's aftermath: the agreements that drew the borders between the Goldhelm mountain strongholds and the Darkmane territories, the Golem Kingdom's underground domain, and the surface territories that became Vacron, Fodon, and the later republics. The racial distributions that current Criozevan considers natural or historical are in fact the product of those agreements — who was alive, where they were, and what they were willing to negotiate for after the fighting stopped.

**Organizational survivors**: the units that became Pegasus maintained their intelligence-sharing network. The manufacturing guilds that survived became the craft traditions that Varnokh's Cridbury workshop traces its lineage to. The shipping networks that operated during the war became the first continental trade routes. The institutions are the war's secondary legacy; the borders are the primary one.
