The **War of Fodon** is the war that drove the Tharnex race to near-extinction. The Tharnex evolved in the Criozevan deserts and were nearly wiped out following this conflict. Legends say surviving Tharnex fled across the sea. **Vorryn**, the Last Drone, is the one known survivor remaining on Criozevan.
