---

The **War of Fodon** (820–847 ACC) was a prolonged civil conflict within the Kingdom of Fodon, fought between four rival districts: **Bug**, **Magic**, **Death**, and **Fire**.

## The Four Districts

The Tharnex — who had evolved in the Criozevan deserts and were heavily concentrated in the **Bug District** — became targets of systematic persecution as the conflict escalated across all districts.

**Vorvax**, the Tharnex matriarch, rose during the conflict as the primary protector of surviving Tharnex. She fortified the Bug District and used her shifting armor and unmatched situational awareness to defend what remained of her people. Despite her efforts, the attrition of decades of war proved devastating.

Legends say that surviving Tharnex fled across the sea. **Vorryn**, the Last Drone, is the one known survivor remaining on Criozevan.

## Lucifer and the End of the Districts

**Lucifer** earned his rank as **#6 of the Arashi** during this conflict by killing all four district leaders:
- **Vorvax** (Bug District)
- **Azaraith, the Nightweaver** (Magic District)
- **Varnokh** (Death District)
- **Vulkran** (Fire District)

With all four leaders dead, the factional structure of the war collapsed.

## Aftermath

From the ruins of the conflict, the four districts formed the **Dune Accord** — a governing council giving each former district equal representation. The Accord built **Ashglass Hall** at the site where Vulkran died, using the fused obsidian and lava glass as a permanent reminder of the war's cost.
