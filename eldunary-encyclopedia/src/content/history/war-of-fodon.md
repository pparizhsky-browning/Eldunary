The **War of Fodon** is not a war in the conventional meaning — it was a divine-level conflict whose battlefield was the spiritual substrate that sustained a civilization, and the casualties were the civilization itself. The Tharnex, a hive-dependent insectoid race with a profound spiritual connection to their god **X'zel**, were functionally dependent on that connection for the biological and psychological systems that made their civilization function. When **Vorvax** — a divine-class entity opposed to X'zel's domain — corrupted that connection, it was not a single battle but a systematic unraveling of everything the Tharnex were.

The mechanics of the corruption are documented only in Tharnex records that **Vorryn** has allowed scholars to access, and those records are incomplete because the archivists who would have maintained them were among the dead. What they describe is the progressive failure of the hive network: queens losing their spiritual signal, drones losing behavioral coherence, the entire civilization's social and biological infrastructure running on an empty channel where X'zel's presence had been. The Tharnex did not lose a battle. Their civilization dissolved.

**X'zel's withdrawal** was both cause and consequence — the god's departure from active Criozevan involvement removed the threat that Vorvax was responding to, but also removed the only possible restoration mechanism for the Tharnex. Whether X'zel chose to leave, was driven out, or remains present in some form that the current era cannot perceive is a theological question that surviving scholars approach with the care appropriate to questions that a living Tharnex (Vorryn) has personal investment in.

The physical territory associated with the Fodon region bears the war's remnant effects in ways that contribute to the area's current character: the desert terrain, the underground crypts beneath Mayson, and the sense in both cities that something important happened here and left its mark permanently in the landscape.
