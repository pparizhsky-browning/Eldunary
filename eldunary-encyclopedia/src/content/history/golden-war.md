The **Golden War** (795–800 ACC) was a civil war fought between the North and South of the Goldhelm Kingdom. The southern territories revolted, demanding political autonomy from the northern crown.

## Alliances

The Northern faction was backed by the **Republic of Frada**. The Southern faction was backed by the **Republic of Shimaguni** (the nation now known as the State of Akison).

## The Three Masters

All three Masters were drawn into the conflict, each for different reasons:

- **Veles** sided with the South. He genuinely believed in the freedom cause — that the southern territories' fight for independence was just and noble.
- **Selvarin** joined the North. His reason was not political conviction: the Goldhelm Kingdom had been helping him forge a sword, and he honored that working relationship by backing them.
- **Sunlee** took no side. He attempted to stop the conflict entirely, traveling between factions to broker peace. When negotiation failed, he fought both sides simultaneously in an effort to end the war by force.

## The Equinox of Power

The war's climax was a three-way battle between all three Masters known as the **Equinox of Power**. The battle ended in a complete stalemate. Upon witnessing the destruction around them, all three chose peace over continuation.

Approximately **500,000 soldiers** were killed across the war. The final battle left an enormous crater in the Ibeson region — the Goldhelm government later built Ibeson's underground laboratories in the caverns beneath it.

## Aftermath

The war reshaped three kingdoms:

- **Sunlee** was elected head of the defeated Republic of Shimaguni. He renamed the nation the **State of Akison** and established the Iron Path doctrine.
- **Selvarin** founded the **Republic of Oredsy** by uniting the collection of small independent territories that had existed in that region before the war.
- **Veles** was voted to the throne of the **Kingdom of Iyhago** by its people, recognizing his role in the conflict. He expanded the kingdom's territory to its current borders over the following decades.
