In the one thousand years since the Crimson Convergence, Fluffy has been publicly sighted exactly five times. These appearances are treated as the closest thing the world has to sacred historical events — each one recorded by those present with a combination of reverence and inadequacy, the accounts surviving in fragments, folktales, and institutional archives that often contradict one another in detail while agreeing on the essential fact: Fluffy appeared, and then it was gone.

## The First Appearance — The Dragon Era *(Pre-Convergence, exact date unknown)*

The oldest record of Fluffy's presence is not a sighting in any conventional sense — it was not witnessed by any living being in the current era, and what is known comes from the fragmented oral traditions of the pre-Convergence world, some of which survived through the Darkmane Elves' ancestral memory and others through Zunarorth himself.

During the final phase of the Dragon Era, as The Shadow moved systematically across the world killing every dragon it could find, witnesses — mainly surviving elf communities in the deep forest — reported seeing something in the sky above the killing grounds that was not the Shadow and was not any dragon. It moved against the Shadow's path, not parallel to it. It did not stop the Shadow. It did not intervene. But those who saw it described the impression of something pursuing — something that was aware of the Shadow and in motion toward it, arriving always slightly too late, or not late at all but choosing not to close the distance.

Whether this account describes Fluffy attempting to intercept the Shadow, following it for reasons of its own, or simply passing through the same sky at the same time is unknown. The Shadow was not stopped. Zunarorth survived. Fluffy, if it was there, did not explain itself.

## The Second Appearance — The Crimson Convergence *(Year 0 ACC)*

The only sighting of Fluffy during the Convergence itself was made by a small group of elves in the final days of the forty-day event, as they fled into the deep forest beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains to escape the lethal red light. The account, preserved in fragments through Darkmane ancestral tradition, describes the fleeing survivors looking back through the canopy and seeing, in the sky above the open land they had just left — still burning with the Convergence light — a shape that was not the star and not the light and not anything they had a name for.

The elves did not stop. They had no way to know what they had seen. The account was passed orally through generations of what would become the Darkmane Elves, and by the time it entered any written form, the specific details had blurred into impressionistic description: something large, something patient, something watching. It did not follow them into the forest. It did not intervene in the Convergence. It watched.

## The Third Appearance — The Equinox of Power *(795 ACC)*

The most documented of Fluffy's appearances occurred during the three-way battle of the Masters that ended the Golden War. The Equinox of Power produced so much concentrated magical energy in a single location — three beings of near-equal power fighting at full force, half a million soldiers dying around them — that the ambient magical field in the region was fundamentally destabilized for days afterward.

In the final minutes of the battle, as the three Masters reached their stalemate and the destruction around them became total, multiple independent witnesses across the battlefield reported the same thing: a figure in an enormous fleece, at a distance, not on the battlefield but visible from it. It did not participate. It did not speak. Those who saw it from farther away described a shape at the edge of the carnage. Those who saw it from closer — including, reportedly, the three Masters themselves, though none has discussed it publicly — described the sense of being seen in return.

It was gone before the silence settled. The Masters stopped fighting. They have never fought each other again. Whether Fluffy's presence was a factor in that decision, or merely a witness to it, is not known.

## The Fourth Appearance — The Ipadora Atrocities *(901 ACC)*

Following the Ipadora Land War, in the year 901, as Frada's forces completed the re-occupation of former Ipadora-held inland territory, the transition was not clean. The Fradan military, operating far from its institutional constraints and in territory that had recently been enemy ground, committed a series of organized atrocities against the Ipadoran civilian population remaining in the reclaimed towns — killings, mass violence, and the systematic destruction of Ipadoran settlements and cultural sites. The Ipadoran civilians who could not retreat had no defense.

Fluffy appeared above one of the burning settlements. A single appearance, brief, above a specific location. It did not prevent the atrocities. It did not intervene. But it was seen, and the soldiers who saw it stopped. Not all of them. Not immediately. But in that settlement, in that hour, the killing paused. Fluffy left. The account was suppressed by Fradan military command and does not appear in any official Fradan record of the war. It survives in Ipadoran oral tradition, where it is recorded not with reverence but with a complicated bitterness: Fluffy came, and then it left, and the war was what it was.

This appearance produced the deepest division in how magic users across the continent interpret Fluffy's non-interventionism. The debate has never been resolved.

## The Fifth Appearance — The Northern Earthquake *(957 ACC)*

In Year 957, a significant earthquake rattled the northern half of the continent without any geological precedent or warning. The event was felt from the Jagged Mountains to Fodon and as far east as Akison's mainland coast. No buildings collapsed, but the tremors lasted long enough — and were strange enough in character, felt as a single sustained shudder rather than a series of shocks — that the event was recorded as anomalous in archives across multiple kingdoms.

At the peak of the tremors, Fluffy was sighted floating above the northern face of the Jagged Mountains — stationary, visible for approximately three minutes, and then gone. Witnesses in Cridbury and the surrounding Nikolem foothills observed it directly. No explanation for the earthquake was ever established. No explanation for Fluffy's presence was offered. The Golem King, who resides within those mountains, has not commented. The Crimson Rooks' formal report on the event lists the earthquake as "unresolved — natural cause unconfirmed" and Fluffy's appearance as "consistent with prior sighting patterns — no engagement with observers, no communication, no intervention."

The earthquake has never recurred. The northern Jagged Mountains show no structural evidence of what caused it.
