The **Equinox of Power** is the event that every current power assessment traces back to — not because it was the first time powerful figures existed in Criozevan, but because it was the first time they became publicly legible as a category. Before the Equinox, power rankings were informal assessments circulated within organizations. After the Equinox, they were acknowledged by every major faction as the practical framework for understanding what Criozevan's existential risk landscape looked like.

The precipitating conditions were the simultaneous convergence of several independent crises whose resolution required the highest-power individuals in Criozevan to act visibly: an Arashi operation that exceeded previous scale parameters, a Butterfly monitoring failure at the Icogas nexus, and a Pegasus-Crimson Rooks confrontation that escalated to personal engagement between organizational leadership. The event lasted approximately fourteen days, involved documented actions in at least seven cities simultaneously, and produced the casualty and infrastructure damage records that organizations still use as worst-case benchmarks in their planning.

**Fluffy's** existence was confirmed during the Equinox — observed, documented, and then un-accountable for by every investigative framework applied afterward. The Crimson Knight's Power Rank #2 position was established by engagement outcomes. The Arashi members active at the time demonstrated capabilities that became their documented profiles. The rankings (#0 through #12 and the named Power Ranks) emerged as the Equinox's primary epistemic output: a shared vocabulary for what existed and at what scale.

The political balance crystallized in the Equinox's aftermath not because anyone won but because the event demonstrated the cost of unresolved conflict at the power levels now publicly legible. Rose's subsequent diplomatic work references the Equinox explicitly. Butterfly's monitoring protocols were rebuilt around its data. Pegasus reorganized its intelligence framework around the power-level intelligence gap the Equinox revealed. Every organization emerged changed, and the changes have been stable enough that the Equinox is treated as the beginning of the current era.
