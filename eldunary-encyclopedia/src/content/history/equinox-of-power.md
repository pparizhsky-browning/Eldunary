The **Equinox of Power** is the climactic three-way battle of the **Great War** (795–800 ACC), in which the three Masters — **Sunlee** (Master of Martial Arts), **Selvarin** (Master of Swords), and **Veles** (Master of Magic) — fought one another simultaneously.

## The Battle

- **Sunlee** fought both Selvarin and Veles in an attempt to end the war, having failed to stop it through diplomacy.
- **Selvarin** fought for the North Goldhelm faction he had committed to.
- **Veles** fought for the South Goldhelm faction whose cause he believed in.

The battle ended in a complete stalemate. No Master could overcome the others.

## Casualties and the Crater

Approximately **500,000 soldiers** were killed across the Great War, with the Equinox of Power as its devastating climax. The battle left an enormous **crater** in the region. The Goldhelm government subsequently built **Ibeson** above and around it — constructing their most sensitive underground research laboratories in the caverns beneath.

## Aftermath

Upon witnessing the total destruction around them, all three Masters chose peace. They have never fought each other again.

This event established that all three Masters hold a roughly equal power level at **Rank #5**, and is cited as the primary reason the current era's political balance has held. It also triggered the reshaping of three kingdoms: the founding of the State of Akison, the founding of the Republic of Oredsy, and Veles' ascension to the throne of Iyhago. See: **The Great War** (History).
