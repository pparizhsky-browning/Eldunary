## Pegasus — Founded Year 738

**Pegasus** was founded in **Year 738** with a genuinely idealistic purpose: to unite the many small, warring independent territories across the continent and broker lasting peace between them.

The organization succeeded. For approximately thirty years following its founding, Pegasus maintained a period of continental stability unprecedented in the post-Convergence era.

## The Collapse

The collapse was internal. As the organization's purpose shifted from peacemaking to maintenance, it required financial contributions from member nations to continue operating. A faction of senior Pegasus agents recognized the opportunity and began systematically redirecting those funds for personal gain. This group climbed to leadership positions and held control of the organization for **six years** while the theft continued.

When member nations discovered what was happening, they withdrew from Pegasus en masse. The organization lost its legitimacy and its mandate simultaneously.

## Rose — Founded Year 780

**Rose** was created in **Year 780** specifically to combat Pegasus — to counter its influence, prevent it from recovering its membership, and ensure that no other nation could be convinced to rejoin or fund it.

The two organizations have been at war ever since. Strikes occur almost weekly across the continent in the ongoing conflict between them.

- Pegasus operates its current covert base in **Oniofast** (State of Akison).
- Rose maintains its leadership meetings in **Anehull** (Kingdom of Vacron) and its headquarters in **Uyrand** (Kingdom of Iyhago).
