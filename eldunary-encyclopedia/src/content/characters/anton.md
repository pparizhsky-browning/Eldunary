summary: "The Scarlet Mage. An enormously powerful Malefici (Scarlet) mage operating from a hidden compound in the Jagged Mountains. Uses Arashi operatives transactionally. Leaves a burning dark symbol as a calling card."
---

Anton is a Scarlet mage — a Malefici whose power is raw, volatile, and capable of running out of control. He operates from a hidden compound within the Jagged Mountains: a cave system converted into a fortified hideout with rough-hewn huts built into the rock face, deep within lawless and largely uninhabitable terrain.

An enormously powerful Scarlet, Anton's magic is barely contained. He is capable of generating devastating waves of dark energy. As a Scarlet, his power can run out of control — making him both incredibly dangerous and inherently unstable.

**Calling Card:** Anton burns a dark, ominous symbol into the ground at locations he has occupied or passed through. The symbol's edges smolder long after his departure — a signature and a warning.

Calculating, manipulative, and patient. Anton is a schemer who operates through proxies, misdirection, and psychological manipulation. He speaks of destiny, hidden power, and the failings of the current order.

Anton has utilized Arashi operatives — specifically Helm and Oto, via Spector's mirror teleportation — but is not a formal member of the Arashi. His relationship with them appears transactional. His ultimate objectives remain shrouded in mystery.
