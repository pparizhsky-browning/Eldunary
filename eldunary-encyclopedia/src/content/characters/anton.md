Anton is a Scarlet mage — a Malefici whose power is raw, volatile, and capable of running out of control. He operated from a hidden compound within the Jagged Mountains: a cave system converted into a fortified hideout with rough-hewn huts built into the rock face, deep within lawless and largely uninhabitable terrain.

An enormously powerful Scarlet, Anton's magic was barely contained. He was capable of generating devastating waves of dark energy. As a Scarlet, his power could run out of control — making him both incredibly dangerous and inherently unstable.

**Calling Card:** Anton burned a dark, ominous symbol into the ground at locations he occupied or passed through. The symbol's edges smoldered long after his departure — a signature and a warning.

Calculating, manipulative, and patient. Anton was a schemer who operated through proxies, misdirection, and psychological manipulation. He spoke of destiny, hidden power, and the failings of the current order.

Anton utilized Arashi operatives — specifically Helm and Oto, via Spector's mirror teleportation — but was not a formal member of the Arashi. His relationship with them was transactional.

## Goals

Anton's true objective was to trigger a second Crimson Convergence — a full reset of the world's magical and political order, mirroring the event that reshaped all life on Eldunary a thousand years ago. He believed the current order is irredeemably corrupt and that only a second Convergence could redistribute power the way the first one did. He was not trying to destroy the world. He genuinely believed he was saving it. His interest in Seraphina was specific: he believed a Devourer who had spent years accumulating ambient magical energy could, at the moment of maximum absorption, release everything simultaneously — producing a shockwave large enough to trigger the Convergence. He was using her as a living catalyst.

## Confirmed Age & Origins

Anton has been active since at least **885 ACC** — confirmed by his involvement in the Wizard Uprising and the First Fire, an attack on an Oredsy settlement documented by Crimson Rooks investigators. This places him at over 115 years old at the time of the trilogy's present. He appeared to be no older than thirty. How a Folkwynd — whose natural lifespan is approximately 85 years — lived more than a century without visible aging is among the most closely studied questions about him. No answer was found.

## The Wizard Uprising Connection

Anton was present during the Wizard Uprising (c. 880–890 ACC) and is believed, with significant probability, to have been among its leaders. He was not identified or captured in the Uprising's aftermath. He went into hiding following its collapse and did not resurface for over a century. His Butterfly archive operative — an ally from the Uprising who had secured a legitimate position in the organization's archival staff — supplied him with restricted information throughout this period. This is how Anton came to know what he knew about the Devourer classification, the Klanron text fragment, and the history he spent a century assembling.

## His Certainty

Anton found out what caused the Crimson Convergence. He died before anyone could ask him. He carries this truth to the grave — the one thing he knew that no one else in the world did — and it goes with him when Seraphina drains him empty.
