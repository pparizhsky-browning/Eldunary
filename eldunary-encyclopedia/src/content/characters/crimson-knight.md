The **Crimson Knight** does not appear in official governance documents for the Kingdom of Vacron. He does not sign treaties. He does not attend diplomatic functions. He is not listed in the Crimson Rooks' published organizational chart. And yet every person in a position of authority in Criozevan who has been doing that work for more than five years knows that the Crimson Knight is the actual center of Vacron's power, the Rooks' ultimate authority, and the single figure whose approval or opposition determines the outcome of the continent's most significant political decisions.

He is Folkwynd — a human, which is to say he began from the same baseline as any other human in Criozevan and reached Power Rank #2 through means that are debated because no one has satisfactorily observed the process. His **Crimson Blade** manifests from his own malefici concentration rather than existing as a physical object, which means it cannot be disarmed, stolen, or destroyed by conventional means. The Void Gauntlets are physical but are treated as near-indestructible by anyone who has seen what happens when he uses them.

His relationship with **Vacron** is the most successful shadow governance model on the continent: a kingdom that runs efficiently, has loyal military forces, a thriving economy, and a population that is largely unaware of the degree to which their lives are shaped by one person's preferences. The Crimson Rooks execute his directives through a chain of command that is both bureaucratically formal and personally loyal to him specifically.

The encounter with **Fluffy** is the most discussed fact about him among those who follow the power hierarchy seriously. He has survived a meeting that left others incapacitated or simply unaccounted for. Whether this means he has some quality that Fluffy finds interesting, some quality that Fluffy finds unthreatening, or simply that he was fast enough to leave before consequences arrived — no one outside that encounter knows.
