**The Crimson Knight** holds Power Rank #2 — the second most powerful known being in Eldunary.

**True Name:** Known only to a select few. Never publicly revealed.

**Race / Birthplace:** Folkwynd, born in Vacron. Appears approximately 40 years old. His true age is significantly older — his aging was halted when Fluffy gifted him the enchanted blazer.

**Abilities:** The Crimson Knight possesses no magical abilities of his own. His power comes from extraordinary combat skill, two legendary items, and unmatched charisma. He is arguably the greatest pure fighter alive — a master of the greatsword with centuries of accumulated experience. His charisma is legendary: he can charm virtually anyone and convince people of almost anything. He is widely considered the most well-liked being in all of Criozevan.

**Equipment:**

**The Crimson Blazer:** A crimson red velvet blazer worn over his knight's armor. Enchanted by Fluffy to be completely indestructible. The blazer also grants its wearer eternal youth and an extended lifespan. Fluffy gave it to the Crimson Knight as a gift in recognition of his efforts to bring peace to Criozevan — approximately 20 years after he founded the Crimson Rooks.

**The Crimson Greatsword:** A massive sword forged from a special steel accessible only to the Golem King, who gave it to the Crimson Knight as a gift of friendship. The sword absorbs the kinetic energy of every impact it receives. In its base state, the blade is dull and dark gray. As it absorbs more hits, it gradually turns redder and redder. When fully charged, the wielder can release all stored energy in a single swing — making the next strike approximately 100 times more powerful than normal. The longer a fight lasts, the more dangerous the Crimson Knight becomes.

**Personality:** Charismatic, warm, and deeply principled. The Crimson Knight leads through presence and persuasion rather than fear. He is universally respected and genuinely liked across nearly every kingdom in Criozevan. Despite his power and influence, he remains approachable and grounded. He seeks guidance from the Golem King, whom he considers his mentor.

**History:** Born a Folkwynd in Vacron, the Crimson Knight rose to prominence through his vision of a peaceful, ordered world. He founded the Crimson Rooks as a peacekeeping force and built it into the most respected organization on the continent. Approximately 20 years after founding the Rooks, Fluffy appeared and gifted him the indestructible crimson blazer — halting his aging. The Golem King, recognizing a kindred spirit, befriended him and gifted him the special steel for his greatsword.

**Key Relationships:** Fluffy gifted him the blazer — one of only three beings to have interacted with Fluffy. The Golem King is his close friend and mentor, who regularly offers him counsel. Zunarorth is one of the three who have interacted with Fluffy alongside the Crimson Knight.
