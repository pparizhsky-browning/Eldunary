The Darkmane call their darkened spiritual path *The Fallen Way*, and they call its actual first practitioner — the elf who made original contact with the void that corrupted their ancestral rune practice — **Azaraith**. Whether this is reverence or accusation has been debated within Darkmane culture for generations. Azaraith does not seem particularly invested in how the debate resolves.

He survived the **First Great War** by being in a location that the war moved around rather than through — a circumstance that he attributes to the void's inexplicable decisions and that scholars attribute to tactical positioning so precise it was observable only in retrospect. He has been present in every subsequent major conflict as an independent actor who does not take sides in the conventional sense but consistently takes positions that ensure specific outcomes that he has not explained publicly.

The **Fracture Blade** is a constructed weapon: literally cast from shattered rune material, which makes it a paradox — a weapon made of the thing it destroys. It disrupts active magical formations on contact, which means any magic deployed in combat against Azaraith is at risk of collapsing the moment he can get the blade near it. Fighting him with sustained spell-work is what his opponents discover is not an option shortly after they begin.

His relationship with **Vaelith the Hollow** is the most consequential current Darkmane dynamic: two figures who emerged from the same cultural tradition and reached entirely different equilibria with what they found there. They have not fought directly. The question of whether they would, and what that would mean for the Darkmane Realm's political future, is the question that matters most to those monitoring the region.
