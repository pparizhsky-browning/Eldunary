summary: "Former ruler of the Magic District of Fodon. Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces with her staff. No one knows what lies behind her mask. Killed by Lucifer (#6 Arashi)."
---

**Azaraith** was the feared ruler of the Magic District of Fodon. Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces with her staff, her power pulsing like a hidden current beneath the city's sands. No one knows what lies behind her mask, but every rumor agrees on one thing: to speak her name is to tempt fate.

She judged all magic users with merciless precision, and even the Arashi once hesitated to challenge her rule.

She was killed by **Lucifer (#6 Arashi)** during the fall of the Fodon districts.
