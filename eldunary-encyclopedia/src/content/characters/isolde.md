Lady Isolde is the Royal Archmedic of Holometric Sciences — head of all holometric medical science in the Goldhelm Kingdom and a senior advisor to King Aldric.

Isolde is one of the most accomplished holotech specialists in the Goldhelm Kingdom. Despite common misconceptions, she is not a mage — she uses advanced holotech exclusively, in accordance with Goldhelm law. Her expertise in holometric medicine allows her to generate holotech healing fields, protective energy barriers, and diagnostic systems. She wields a holotech staff that serves as both a medical instrument and a defensive tool. Her skill with holotech is so refined that her work is often mistaken for magic by outsiders unfamiliar with Goldhelm technology.

Wise, composed, and fiercely protective. Isolde carries herself with quiet authority. She is deeply devoted to Princess Seraphina, having watched over her since childhood — her bond with the princess is maternal in nature. Beneath her calm exterior lies an iron will and a sharp strategic mind.

She rose through the Department of Holometric Advancement through exceptional skill in medical applications. Her appointment as Royal Archmedic placed her at the highest levels of Goldhelm's government. Her relationship with Sir Elric is one of mutual respect and shared duty; together, they form the core of Seraphina's protection.

**The Secret She Carries:** Years ago, during routine holometric medical scans of Seraphina as a child, Isolde's instruments detected a persistent anomaly — not a positive magical signature, but an absence. A small, consistent hole in the expected ambient energy readings in Seraphina's vicinity, as if something nearby was being continuously consumed. The readings did not match any known holotech malfunction or known magical signature. Isolde ran the scans repeatedly. The anomaly was always present around Seraphina and only around Seraphina. She buried the data, destroyed the records, and adjusted her diagnostic parameters to filter out the anomaly so that no other scientist would find it. She did not understand what it meant — only that reporting it would trigger an investigation that could cost Seraphina her life under Goldhelm law. She has been carrying this secret ever since.
