Lady Isolde is the Royal Archmedic of Holometric Sciences — head of all holometric medical science in the Goldhelm Kingdom and a senior advisor to King Aldric.

Isolde is one of the most accomplished holotech specialists in the Goldhelm Kingdom. Despite common misconceptions, she is not a mage — she uses advanced holotech exclusively, in accordance with Goldhelm law. Her expertise in holometric medicine allows her to generate holotech healing fields, protective energy barriers, and diagnostic systems. She wields a holotech staff that serves as both a medical instrument and a defensive tool. Her skill with holotech is so refined that her work is often mistaken for magic by outsiders unfamiliar with Goldhelm technology.

Wise, composed, and fiercely protective. Isolde carries herself with quiet authority. She is deeply devoted to Princess Seraphina, having watched over her since childhood — her bond with the princess is maternal in nature. Beneath her calm exterior lies an iron will and a sharp strategic mind.

She rose through the Department of Holometric Advancement through exceptional skill in medical applications. Her appointment as Royal Archmedic placed her at the highest levels of Goldhelm's government. Her relationship with Sir Elric is one of mutual respect and shared duty; together, they form the core of Seraphina's protection.
