**Vorvax** was the leader of Fodon's Bug District, ruling from the shadows with shifting armor that sensed incoming danger. She trusted no one but her own. Her eyes missed nothing, and her will to protect the scattered bugfolk was legendary.

She is rumored to have been the last matriarch of the Tharnex race. In a city built on betrayal, Vorvax was the one presence you never saw coming — until it was far too late.

She was killed by **Lucifer (#6 Arashi)** during the fall of the Fodon districts. Once she was killed, the rest of the Tharnex race perished.
