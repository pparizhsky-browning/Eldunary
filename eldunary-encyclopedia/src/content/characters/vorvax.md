**Vorvax** is ranked #1 in the power hierarchy because it is the highest confirmed entity below Fluffy, and the designation comes with significant uncertainty about what *confirmed* means when the entity in question has no fixed form, no consistent location, and effects that are inferred rather than directly observed.

The evidence for Vorvax as a distinct entity rather than a mythological construction comes primarily from the **War of Fodon**: the corruption patterns that destroyed the Tharnex hive networks bore characteristics that no known malefici or runestone magic could produce — a systematic dissolution of the X'zel-aligned spiritual substrate that the Tharnex depended on, which forced X'zel's departure from active involvement in Criozevan's affairs and left the Tharnex without the divine connection that their biological systems required. Something caused this. The theological scholars who studied the aftermath concluded that the cause was an entity of divine-class power operating in opposition to X'zel's domain.

Whether Vorvax is actively present in Criozevan, dormant, operating through intermediaries, or simply exerted its influence and withdrew is unknown. **Vorryn's** persistent movement toward something unspecified is the closest thing to a tracking indicator that anyone has — the last Tharnex, following a pull that Vorvax may or may not have created, is the only real-time indicator of Vorvax's relevance that the continent has access to.

The **Fluffy** ranking above Vorvax is based on the one recorded encounter where something Vorvax-adjacent was observed to alter course. The cause of that alteration has not been confirmed. The correlation is everything.
