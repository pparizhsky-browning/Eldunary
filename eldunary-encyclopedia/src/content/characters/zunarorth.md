summary: "Power Rank #6. One of the oldest Golems in Criozevan. Golem King's most trusted lieutenant. Operates in the Suudon swamp. The only Golem capable of rewriting another Golem's rune-mind."
---

**Zunarorth** predates most of Criozevan's current political geography. He was present at the end of the First Great War, served under the Golem King during the Golden War, and has continued existing while governments formed, collapsed, and reformed around him. Stone is patient in ways that organisms are not, and Zunarorth has developed patience into something more like an active philosophy: the world hurries toward outcomes that the careful observer can predict centuries in advance if they simply stop moving long enough to watch.

His physical form is the largest of the current Golems — twelve feet of sedimentary stone assembled over his original Karthrun-carved core, which has accumulated layered mineral deposits the way old riverbeds accumulate silt. The fist that produces his signature seismic strikes is the size of a wagon wheel and hits the ground with the mechanical efficiency of a designed instrument rather than an act of violence.

The ability to **rewrite another Golem's rune-mind** is extraordinary and dangerous — Golems are programmed at creation with their core purposes and behavioral constraints, and those parameters are normally fixed for the Golem's lifetime. That Zunarorth can alter them means he can, in principle, repurpose any Golem he can get close enough to touch. The Golem King trusts him with this capacity because Zunarorth has never once used it without direct authorization.

He and **Nebbio (#3 Arashi)** share operational territory in the Suudon swamp and have worked in parallel for years with something approaching mutual respect, though neither has confirmed this interpretation when asked.
