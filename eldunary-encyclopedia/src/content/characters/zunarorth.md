**Zunarorth** holds Power Rank #3 — the last surviving dragon from the Dragon Era, ancient and feared.

**Age / Race:** Thousands of years old — predates the Crimson Convergence. A survivor of the Dragon Era.

**Location:** Unknown. Zunarorth has not been reliably seen in hundreds of years. Approximately every 100 years, a sighting is reported somewhere in Eldunary — but these could be rumors.

**Personality:** Solitary, elusive, and shaped by a depth of time that makes most living concerns feel brief. Dragons during their era were intelligent but not social — they built nothing, governed nothing, recorded nothing. They were territorial beings of immense individual power who existed largely in parallel to the world rather than within it. Zunarorth carries this nature into the present: he does not seek contact, does not involve himself in the affairs of kingdoms or factions, and regards the political architecture of the post-Convergence world with something between indifference and contempt. The wilderness is his native condition. Stillness is his default. He speaks when he chooses to and not before. The extreme reclusiveness of his current existence is not simply personality — it is the compounded weight of being the only survivor of an extinction, filtered through a thousand years of watching a world that replaced everything he knew with something smaller and louder. He does not hate that world. He simply does not belong to it.

**History:** Zunarorth lived during the Dragon Era, when dragons dominated the world of Eldunary. That era ended when a mysterious entity known only as The Shadow appeared and systematically exterminated every dragon on the planet. The Shadow's origin is unknown. After completing its slaughter, The Shadow vanished and has never been seen again. Zunarorth is the sole known survivor, having managed to escape and hide from The Shadow. This experience is believed to be the reason he emerges so rarely.

**Key Relationships:** The Crimson Knight, Golem King, and Fluffy have all interacted with him. His existence in the current era is somewhere between fact and legend.
