Power Rank #5. Master of Martial Arts. Leader of the State of Akison. Governs through the doctrine of the Iron Path — discipline, clarity, and personal strength. Never speaks more than necessary; his presence alone commands entire rooms. Said to have forged the Iron Path after defeating over a dozen crime kings and rebel clan lords with his bare hands. Carries only the Black Root — a metalwood staff from the old jungle. No armor, no magic.

## The Great War

During the Great War (795–800 ACC), Sunlee took no side. He attempted to stop the conflict entirely, traveling between the North and South Goldhelm factions to broker peace. When diplomacy failed, he fought both sides simultaneously — not for either faction, but against the idea that the war was acceptable at all. His effort culminated in the Equinox of Power, the three-way battle that ended the war in a stalemate. Upon witnessing the destruction, all three Masters chose peace.

Following the war's end, Sunlee was elected head of the defeated Republic of Shimaguni. He renamed the nation the **State of Akison** and established the Iron Path doctrine as its governing philosophy.
