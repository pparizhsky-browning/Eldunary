Power Rank #5. Master of Martial Arts. Leader of the State of Akison. Governs through the doctrine of the Iron Path — discipline, clarity, and personal strength. Never speaks more than necessary; his presence alone commands entire rooms. Said to have forged the Iron Path after defeating over a dozen crime kings and rebel clan lords with his bare hands. Carries only the Black Root — a metalwood staff from the old jungle. No armor, no magic.
