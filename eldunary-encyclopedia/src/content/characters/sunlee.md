**Sunlee** built the Iron Path as a governing philosophy, a martial discipline, and a way of living — and the fact that he embodies all three simultaneously is why the State of Akison functions with unusual coherence for a nation that has no traditional monarchy, no religious authority, and no hereditary power structure. The Iron Path is what Sunlee is, made into a system that other people can follow, even if they cannot follow it as completely as he does.

His martial ability is Power Rank #5 by the standard continental ranking, but that number understates a relevant distinction: while most Power Rank #5 figures achieve their ranking through magical amplification of physical ability, Sunlee's ranking is achieved almost entirely through physical mastery. His Ki amplification uses mana-adjacent internal energy rather than external magic, which means he operates in anti-magic zones with near-full capacity while most other same-rank figures are significantly diminished.

The **Black Root Staff** is his most discussed weapon — a living construct of ancient wood that absorbs kinetic energy from impacts rather than transferring it to the wielder, then releases stored energy on Sunlee's direction. In practice, this means that fighting Sunlee with a weapon causes his primary instrument to grow stronger over the course of the fight. The staff has not been struck enough times in any single engagement to reach its known capacity limits.

**Biruda (#7 Arashi)** trained under Sunlee before leaving Akison. The Akison-Biruda relationship is complex — Sunlee respected Biruda's potential and was disappointed not in his power but in his choice to become something the Iron Path could not contain. They have not fought since Biruda left. Those who know both figures consider this a meaningful choice by both.
