**Vaelith the Hollow** acquired the name she is known by after surviving an attack that should not have been survivable — a concentrated corrupted-rune detonation at contact range that obliterated what should have been substantial parts of her physiology. She survived because the Hollow Void ability had, at that point, already developed enough to route the damage into null space. She came out of the experience changed, the surviving attackers came out of it not at all, and the legend began.

She operates in **Grousea** as its de facto ruler — not by formal appointment, which would require the Darkmane tribal structure to reach consensus, but by the simpler and more durable authority of being the person who no one in Grousea chooses to oppose. The criminal networks that the city hosts pay their arrangements through her. The power-brokers who use Grousea as a neutral meeting point do so with her tacit permission. Her enforcement is invisible until it isn't.

The **Hollow Void** is the most discussed of her abilities because it has no identified counter in any documented engagement. Physical attacks, magical projections, and even reality-level abilities have been absorbed by the void she maintains within her form. The theoretical explanation — that her surviving that original explosion burned a permanent null-space channel into her physical structure that she learned to control — is the most commonly cited one, but no one has confirmed it empirically.

Her personal motivations are the least well-understood of any major figure in Criozevan — those who have worked with her long enough to develop a sense of what she wants describe conflicting impressions. What is consistent is that she does not operate according to any external organization's framework, and the Darkmane cultural identity she holds is as much a statement of what she left behind as what she still carries.
