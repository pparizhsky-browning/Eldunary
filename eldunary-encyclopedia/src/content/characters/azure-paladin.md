**The Azure Paladin** is the name given to the man who would eventually become the **Dark Paladin** — Arashi #1 — during the forty years before his corruption. He is not two different people. He is one person with a before.

## Origins

Born in **Vacron in 692 ACC**, he grew up in the same district as the man who would become the **Crimson Knight**. They were companions through childhood and early adulthood — training in the same streets, fighting the same local disputes, developing the same formative conviction that Criozevan's chronic violence and disorder was a problem requiring a solution.

The difference was always methodological, and it was present from the beginning. The Crimson Knight believed the continent's disorder could be reduced through trust, diplomacy, and the cultivation of shared interest. He wanted people to want peace. The Azure Paladin did not believe that was achievable without first creating the conditions for it by force. He did not think the Crimson Knight was wrong about the goal. He thought he was wrong about what it would take to get there.

## The Divergence (712–715 ACC)

In **712 ACC**, the Crimson Knight founded the **Crimson Rooks** — a peacekeeping institution built on earned legitimacy and voluntary cooperation. The Azure Paladin disagreed with the approach and believed it would take generations to achieve anything meaningful.

In **715 ACC**, the Azure Paladin founded the **Republic of Frada** — a military republic organized around the principle that a single governing authority, if disciplined and just, could end the continent's fragmentation by absorbing it. He built Frada quickly. He ran it with conviction. He was, by most accounts, a capable ruler — rigorous, present, and genuinely committed to the order he was building.

They did not stop being companions when their projects diverged. But they stopped agreeing. The Crimson Knight visited Frada repeatedly over the following years, making clear what he thought of the conquest campaigns. The Azure Paladin listened and did not change course.

## The Campaigns (715–732 ACC)

Over seventeen years, the Azure Paladin expanded Frada's borders through military conquest. He operated under a consistent ideological framework: that territories brought into Frada's governance would, over time, benefit from the order he imposed. He was not indifferent to the cost. He believed it was worth paying.

In **730 ACC**, Frada conquered the **Eshar-Thi** — a small union nation occupying the territory around Uyrand and Andport. It was militarily straightforward and geographically significant. Frada now had reach toward the southern coast.

The Crimson Knight visited him again that year. He asked him to stop. The Azure Paladin did not stop.

## The Moment of Corruption (732 ACC)

In **732 ACC**, **Fluffy** — the most powerful being in Eldunary, responsible for all magic — appeared before the Crimson Knight and gifted him the indestructible crimson blazer. It was a public recognition: a gift from the god of magic to the man who had built peacekeeping through consent, specifically because of the work he had done and the path he had chosen.

The Azure Paladin was present, or learned of it immediately. He had spent seventeen years fighting wars he framed as necessary for the same goal the Crimson Knight was now being rewarded for refusing to pursue by force. Fluffy had appeared specifically to recognize a different answer.

He did not accept this. Not the gift, not the judgment it represented, not the implication that everything he had built was a wrong answer to a question that had a right one.

He turned to dark magic — not as a last resort, not in desperation, but in fury. He gave himself power beyond what any mortal had a right to and, in doing so, put himself permanently beyond the path he and the Crimson Knight had once been walking together. He stopped aging at that moment. He has not aged since.

He became the **Dark Paladin**.

## What He Left Behind

The Republic of Frada outlasted him. After his departure from its governance, Frada evolved from a conquest-oriented state into the military republic it is today — disciplined, structured, built on what he made, but no longer pursuing what he intended it to become. His founding ideology was not preserved in Frada's institutional memory. What remained was the architecture without the intent.

His name before the dark magic is not recorded in any surviving Criozevan archive. Whether it was deliberately suppressed or simply forgotten across three centuries is unknown. He is referred to in historical records as the Azure Paladin — a title, not a name.

He is now referred to as the **Dark Paladin**. See: Arashi, #1.
