**Varnokh** is the Golem whose craft keeps the race alive in the most literal sense — he is the primary practitioner of advanced Karthrun inscription who can create new Golems, repair damaged ones, and most critically, reactivate Golems whose rune-minds have gone dormant through damage or age. The Golem King created the race; Varnokh maintains it.

He lives in **Cridbury** because the finest mineral deposits for Golem construction are mined there, and because the mountain quiet suits a craftsman who needs sustained concentration for the inscription work that can take weeks per Golem. His workshop is built into the mountain directly — rock walls, stone floor, forge-complex powered by deep geothermal vents, and a library of Karthrun inscription records that is the most complete archive of the written form of the Golem language in Criozevan.

His assessment of **Karthrun's Living Dictionary** is accurate in the formal sense: he is the keeper of inscription knowledge, which means he is the primary authority on what the language's scripts can and cannot do when inscribed into stone. New Golem forms — modifications to the race's programming beyond what the Golem King's original designs specified — require his consultation, his approval, and usually his direct involvement in the inscription process.

The **Forge Hammer** functions adequately as a weapon when necessary, which is not often. Varnokh's primary defense is the simple fact that attacking a Golem who can restructure the stone around him in real time, in a mountain environment, is among the most comprehensively inadvisable tactical choices available.
