Power Rank #5. Master of Swords. Leader of the Republic of Oredsy. Title: Kirel’dra Tharnic (‘Speaker of the Sword’s Truth’). Embodies the civic virtues of clarity, strength, and fairness. Mediates disputes of national consequence, leads the militia in wartime, and sets training standards.
## The Great War

During the Great War (795–800 ACC), Selvarin joined the North Goldhelm faction. His reason was not political conviction: the Goldhelm Kingdom had been helping him forge a sword, and he honored that working relationship by backing them. He fought for the North not because he believed in the cause, but because he believed in honoring his commitments.

After the war ended with the Equinox of Power, Selvarin used his standing to found the **Republic of Oredsy** by uniting the collection of small, independent territories that had previously existed without unified governance in that region.
