**Selvarin** does not lock his doors. This is known throughout Oredsy and discussed in organizations that track significant figures. The interpretation is straightforward to anyone who understands how he thinks: if you can get past him, you deserve to be inside. If you cannot, lock doesn't matter. The logic is clean, his assessment of likelihood is accurate, and the fact that no one has ever successfully broken into his home without his invitation is the record that validates the reasoning.

His sword mastery is the most technically analyzed in Criozevan because Oredsy's culture of public dueling means he has the most documented combat record of any Power Rank #5 figure. Scholars have reviewed thousands of bouts. The consensus finding is that **Absolute Combat Reading** — his ability to process an opponent's intent before it becomes motion — functions at a level that makes conversations about his *skill* somewhat beside the point. He does not beat people because he is faster or stronger (though he is both). He beats them because he has already finished the fight at the strategic level before either blade moves.

**Vaelrin's Edge** is not demonstrably more powerful than any other good blade. Its significance is historical — it belonged to the hero whose sacrifice the Tower of Vaelrin commemorates, and Selvarin carries it as a statement about what he represents, not as a tool he depends on. He has won bouts with borrowed swords. He has won unarmed.

His governance philosophy aligns precisely with Oredsy's: merit demonstrated openly, challenges accepted honestly, results respected unconditionally. **Pegasus** controls Oredsy at the strategic level, which Selvarin tolerates because Pegasus has never yet given him a reason to consider the relationship an imposition. This is a condition, not a permanent state.
