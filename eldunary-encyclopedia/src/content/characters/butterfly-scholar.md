**Ossivael** is an Ipadora scholar affiliated with the Butterfly organization, Klanron chapter. He has spent long enough in Klanron that people stop noticing he is an Ipadora — which is, in practice, the most useful thing about him.

## Research

Ossivael has spent years studying a single damaged pre-Convergence text fragment held in the Klanron archive. The fragment uses a word that translates roughly as *the hungry ones* — or, in more poetic rendering, *those who remember what the world was before magic had a shape.*

He has developed a partial theory connecting this fragment to anomalous magical phenomena reported near the Goldhelm border across centuries: small, consistent gaps in ambient magical readings, magic users who weakened without explanation, incidents that don't fit any known classification and have been historically misattributed to illness, curse, or environmental conditions.

He cannot prove the connection. He has not been able to prove it for years. He has also not been able to stop.

## Status

Active in Klanron. His theory is known within the Butterfly organization and regarded as an interesting dead end — the kind of work that gets respected and quietly set aside.
