**Sael** is the leader of the warriors of the main branch of the Darkmane family — the granddaughter of **Vaelith the Hollow**.

She is known for making deals with travelers: safe passage through the Warring Darkmane Realm in exchange for something of value in return. This is both a practical measure and a reflection of her broader ambition. Sael strives to build toward a unified Darkmane kingdom once again — one that does not exist in name yet, but that she intends to make real.
