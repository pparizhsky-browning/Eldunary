**King Aldric** has ruled the Goldhelm Kingdom for long enough that there are Goldhelm citizens who have no personal memory of a different monarch. He inherited a kingdom recovering from the **Golden War** and interpreted that recovery as a mandate for isolation: if the outside world brought conflict, the outside world must be kept outside. The Goldhelm borders, never welcoming, became fortified. The magic ban, already cultural law, became formal administrative policy with enforcement consequences.

His governance model is technocratic in the truest sense: he makes decisions based on data, delegates based on expertise, and holds officials to measurable outcomes. The **Auric Vanguard** under his leadership became the most systematically trained military force in Criozevan for the specific purpose of defending static positions against external threats — they are excellent in Goldhelm territory and considerably less effective when operating outside a prepared defensive environment, which is exactly why Aldric never deploys them offensively.

The **Gilded Aegis** is both status symbol and legitimate weapon: a shield form that generates electromagnetic barriers strong enough to stop magical projectiles, combined with a holotech cannon system that can function as a portable turret. Aldric is not a frontline combatant; he is a commander. When forced into personal engagement, the Aegis allows him to hold a position while directing forces rather than fighting conventionally.

**Princess Seraphina** is his daughter and, in succession position, his heir. The tension between her curiosity about the outside world and his insistence on its dangers is the most consequential domestic relationship in the Goldhelm court — whatever she decides when she assumes authority will determine whether the Kingdom's next era continues isolation or attempts something more complicated.
