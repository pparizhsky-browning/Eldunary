Sir Elric is the Captain of the Goldhelm royal guard — the highest individual military appointment in the Goldhelm Kingdom. He stands at King Aldric's right hand in all matters of defense and security.

A seasoned warrior and brilliant tactician, Elric is trained in the full Goldhelm military doctrine and wields holotech weaponry, including a holotech sword. He is known for his strategic mind, capable of reading battlefields and adapting plans under pressure.

Stoic, loyal, and resolute. Elric's defining trait is his unwavering dedication to the Goldhelm royal family — particularly Princess Seraphina, whom he has protected and mentored since her childhood. He is not a man of many words, preferring action over speech, but when he does speak, his voice carries the weight of hard-earned authority.

He rose through the ranks of the Goldhelm military through skill and merit. His reputation for loyalty and tactical acumen is known throughout the Goldhelm Kingdom.
