Power Rank #5. Master of Magic. Leader of the Kingdom of Iyhago. Speaks only through harmonic pulses interpreted by chosen attendants. Believed to commune directly with the divine pattern guiding the Quiet Harmonic faith.

## Background

Born in Iyhago. Had long been respected across the continent before the Great War.

## The Great War

During the Great War (795–800 ACC), Veles sided with the South Goldhelm faction. He genuinely believed the southern territories' fight for political autonomy was just and noble — his alignment was a matter of conviction, not strategy.

When the war ended with the Equinox of Power, the people of Iyhago voted him to the throne in recognition of his role. He expanded the Kingdom of Iyhago's territory to its current borders over the following decades.
