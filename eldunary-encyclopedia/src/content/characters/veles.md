**Veles** holds more accumulated spell knowledge than any living practitioner in Criozevan — not because he is the oldest (he is not) or because he has the most raw power (he has peers), but because he has spent his entire life in systematic study with the specific goal of understanding every magical form that has ever existed. His tower in the Sanctum Spiral is larger inside than outside, and the differential between those two dimensions is one of the more accessible demonstrations of what he can do with sustained spatial magic.

He speaks **Kōtoba** by strong preference and common language only when unavoidable necessity demands it. This is not affectation — spoken Kōtoba has a documented amplifying effect on malefici casting, and Veles has shaped his entire practice around this enhancement. Visitors to his study who speak Kōtoba are given more time. Those who arrive in common and refuse to learn any Kōtoba before their second visit are made aware politely that the Master of Magic's time is finite.

His **Temporal Suspension** ability is the most debated of his capabilities — the ability to create local time dilation fields that slow events within a defined area relative to events outside it. No other malefici practitioner has replicated it. The academic community's best explanation is that it requires a foundational understanding of magical theory so comprehensive that the practitioner can access laws that are not normally available to those working within partial knowledge.

The **Magic Societies** operate partially through his intellectual authority — he is not their administrative head, but his positions on magical philosophy, acceptable practice, and the ethics of magic use carry more practical weight than any organizational governance document the Societies have ever produced.
