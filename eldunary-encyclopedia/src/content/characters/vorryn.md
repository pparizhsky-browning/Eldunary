**Vorryn** should not exist. By the conclusion of the **War of Fodon**, the Tharnex race was functionally extinct — their hive networks destroyed, their queen-caste obliterated, their genetic continuity severed. The fact that one nest-born Tharnex drone survived, wandered out of the war's aftermath, and continued living is an accident of circumstance so improbable that Tharnex scholars (of whom Vorryn is now the only practical authority) consider it either miraculous or a final cruel joke.

The **Last Drone ability** emerged after he spent decades as the sole remaining Tharnex. The pheromone network that Tharnex use for hivemind communication, without other Tharnex to connect to, turned inward — amplifying the single mind it still had access to beyond what any single Tharnex was ever designed to reach. He thinks faster than most organisms of any race, perceives biochemical information at range, and maintains a consciousness that operates on multiple parallel tracks simultaneously, as if the hivemind capacity never went away but consolidated into one extraordinary individual instead.

He does not speak much in any common tongue. Communication with him happens through gesture, biochemical signal, and the occasional written exchange with those patient enough to learn the rudiments of Tharnex notation. **Vorvax** (if that entity is real rather than Vorryn's mythology) is what he moves toward — not a goal so much as a pull, a direction without a destination explained.

What he will do when he runs out of world to move through is not a question anyone has been able to ask him and receive an answer to.
