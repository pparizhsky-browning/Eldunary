**The Golem King** holds Power Rank #4 — though this ranking is misleading. He is believed to possess power equal to Fluffy's, and is ranked lower solely because he chooses never to use his full abilities.

**Appearance:** Visually distinct from all other Golems. Stands approximately 100 feet tall — dwarfing even the largest of his creations (8–9 ft). His body is covered in thousands of runes, their purposes largely unknown. No member of the public has seen the Golem King since the Crimson Convergence.

**Location:** The largest, most isolated mountain in the Nikolem Kingdom. He has never left it since the Crimson Convergence.

**Abilities:** Creator of all Golems — the only being capable of forging true sentient Golems using ancient rune forges. Master of rune magic on a scale no other being can approach. He uses his power only for what he considers good, and even then, sparingly. He rarely creates new Golems — only when the kingdom truly needs them.

**True Name:** Has a true name in Karthrun (the Golem language). Not publicly known.

**Personality:** Wise, patient, philosophical, and deeply protective. The Golem King views the world with a perspective shaped by thousands of years of existence. He speaks rarely and acts even more rarely, but when he does, the consequences are profound. He has taken on a mentorship role with the Crimson Knight, offering guidance and counsel.

**History:** The Golem King existed during the Dragon Era, long before the Crimson Convergence. He and Fluffy are believed to have been born or created around the same time. He established the Nikolem Kingdom after the Convergence, creating Golems to inhabit and guard it. He placed powerful runes throughout the region — including deep in the Darkmane forest. Those runes became unstable after he stopped maintaining them due to ongoing wars, and their original purpose remains a mystery.

**Key Relationships:** Fluffy — the oldest known relationship in Eldunary; they have known each other since before recorded history and are believed to be equals in raw power. Crimson Knight — close friend and apprentice; gifted him the special steel for the Crimson Greatsword.
