The **Golem King** does not claim to be a god, but the distinction matters less with each passing century. He created the Golem race — inscribed the first Karthrun runes into stone and gave them will, purpose, and the capacity to know themselves. Every Golem alive owes their existence to either his hand directly or to the methods he established. He is their creator, their sovereign, and in the theological conception of Golem culture, their divine origin made material.

He rules the **Nikolem Kingdom** with the understanding that his subjects — Golems — are incapable of overthrow. A Golem King can only lose his kingdom if every Golem chooses not to follow him, and the programming of every Golem he created included the disposition toward loyalty to the source of their existence. Whether this constitutes genuine governance or an extremely sophisticated self-preservation system is a philosophical question that Golem King finds uninteresting.

His **Grand Rune Hammer** bears the original inscription that started everything — the first Karthrun rune sequence he ever carved, pressed into a hammer head so old that geologists who have dated stone from his public appearances estimate it predates the current geological era. He does not use it often. When he does, the seismic record is measurable at instruments in every kingdom on the continent.

The **Stone Domain** realm expansion ability is his signature power in recorded combat: a conversion of the surrounding terrain to a field of shaped stone, in which his authority over the material is absolute. No other practitioner can function optimally in the Stone Domain — movement slows, combat angles collapse, and the terrain itself becomes an active participant working against anyone fighting the Golem King.
