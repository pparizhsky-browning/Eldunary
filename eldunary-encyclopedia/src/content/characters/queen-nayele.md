**Queen Nayele of the Tide** is the Queen of the Ipadora Kingdom and head of House Nereval. She ascended to the throne in **996 ACC** following the death of her father. She has been in power for four years at the time of the trilogy's present.

## Personality

Genuinely kind and deeply compassionate — not as a political style but as a sincere orientation toward the world. Nayele cares about the people her decisions affect in a way that is not strategic and is not always useful. She is frequently criticized, including by members of her own government, for being intellectually outmatched by the role — for making decisions slowly, for deferring too often, for failing to project the certainty that a queen is expected to project. The criticism is not entirely wrong. She is not her brother. She knows this. She has made peace with it in the way people make peace with things they cannot change.

## Governance

In four years, she has not altered anything fundamental about how Ipadora is governed. What she has done is smaller and more durable: she has improved Ipadora's standing as a genuinely neutral party in continental politics, and she has restructured the waterway tax system that is Ipadora's primary economic lever. The new system scales taxation to the size and wealth of the ships and companies using Ipadoran waterways — larger nations and commercial fleets pay more; smaller traders and independent vessels pay less. The revision was politically contentious but has held.

## The Ipadora Justice System

Under Nayele's tenure, the Ipadora Justice System (IJS) has become recognized across the continent as one of the most equitable court systems in Criozevan. The **Ipadora Sanctuary Academy of Justice (ISAJ)** is the most highly regarded law school on the continent. Nayele did not create the IJS — it predates her — but her personal emphasis on the Sanctuary's role as a refuge for all peoples has expanded both institutions' reputations significantly. The IJS accepts cases from individuals regardless of their kingdom of origin.

## Military

Nayele commands the Ipadora armed forces — a massive naval and underwater military that constantly patrols the seas and waterways of the continent. The waterways enforcement division operates at an estimated ratio of three officers per ship.

## Her Brother

Nayele's relationship with Prince Vaelen is one of the most uncomplicated things in her life. She loves him without complication and appointed him to govern Glaril immediately upon taking power — not as a political maneuver but because she trusts him entirely and believes, correctly, that he is better suited to the complexity of Glaril's governance than she is to many of the things she has to do. She does not resent this. She is glad he is where he is.
