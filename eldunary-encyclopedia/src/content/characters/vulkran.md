**Vulkran** is not dead. This is the most important thing that the residents of **Plodrough** know about their city, and it is what keeps the canyon town warm through the winters that would otherwise make the deep canyon uninhabitable.

He sleeps in the lower canyon, his body partially merged with the canyon walls over centuries of dormancy — the rock has grown around him, through him, and the distinction between where the canyon ends and where Vulkran begins is no longer clear to any geological survey that has attempted to map it. His scale-surface is exposed in places along the lower canyon walls, and those surfaces are identifiable by their temperature: slightly warmer than ambient stone at any time of year.

The **thermal output** of a dormant dragon of his class is sufficient to raise the ambient temperature of the entire canyon system by several degrees — enough, in Fodon's desert-cold winters, to make the difference between habitable and not for the town above. The residents of Plodrough are aware of this and maintain a tradition of leaving offerings at the canyon's lower entrance on the first day of each winter, which no one seriously believes Vulkran is conscious enough to receive, but which no one is willing to stop performing.

He has been dormant since the final engagements of the **First Great War**. What woke him enough to take that position in the first place, what combat he was involved in, and what would wake him fully are questions that scholars frame carefully because the answer to the last one has obvious implications for everyone within thermal range when it happens.
