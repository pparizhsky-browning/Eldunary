summary: "Power Rank #1. The most powerful known being in Eldunary. Primordial entity — predates the Crimson Convergence by thousands of years. Regarded as the god of all magic users. Publicly sighted exactly five times in the thousand years since the Convergence. Non-interventionist by consistent practice — though the fourth appearance (Ipadora Atrocities, 901 ACC) remains the deepest source of controversy among magic users."

**Fluffy** holds Power Rank #1 — the most powerful known being in Eldunary.

**Race / Age:** Race unknown — a primordial entity that predates the Crimson Convergence by thousands of years. One of the oldest known beings in Eldunary.

**Appearance:** Fluffy wears an enormous, distinctive fleece that obscures its true form. What lies beneath the fleece — if anything — is unknown. The fleece itself is not merely clothing but a vessel of power, containing thousands of stored enchanted items. The name 'Fluffy' was given by others based on the fleece's appearance; the entity has no known true name.

**Abilities:** Omnipotent magical authority. Can give, take, transfer, or nullify any form of magic. Can enchant any item with any magical property. Stores thousands of enchanted items within its fleece, granting it functionally infinite magical power. Communicates telepathically. The closest classification for its abilities is Meta magic, but Fluffy transcends all known Magi categories. It is regarded as the god of all magic users.

**Personality:** Passive and non-interventionist. Despite possessing the power to do virtually anything, Fluffy has never intervened in any conflict in recorded history. It appears only in the most extraordinary circumstances and for reasons known only to itself.

**History:** Fluffy existed during the Dragon Era, thousands of years before the Crimson Convergence. It has known the Golem King since the beginning of time — the two are believed to have been born or created around the same period, near the very origin of Eldunary. In the 1,000 years since the Convergence, Fluffy has been publicly sighted only five times. It has never explained its appearances or its motives.

**Key Relationships:** Only three known beings have personally interacted with Fluffy: the Crimson Knight, Zunarorth, and the Golem King. Fluffy gifted the Crimson Knight his indestructible crimson velvet blazer as recognition of his peacekeeping efforts in Criozevan. The nature of Fluffy's interaction with Zunarorth is unknown. Fluffy and the Golem King share the oldest known relationship in Eldunary — they have known each other since before recorded history.

**Public Perception:** Revered as a deity by many magic users. Most people in Criozevan have never seen Fluffy and regard it as somewhere between a god and a myth. Its five public appearances in 1,000 years are treated as sacred historical events by those who witnessed them.

## The Five Public Appearances

See: [The Five Public Appearances of Fluffy](five-appearances-of-fluffy) for the full account of each sighting.

In summary:
1. **The Dragon Era** — Pre-Convergence. Seen moving against the Shadow's path during the final dragon killings. Did not intervene.
2. **The Crimson Convergence (Year 0 ACC)** — Seen by fleeing elves above the burning open land. Described as large, patient, watching.
3. **The Equinox of Power (795 ACC)** — Most documented appearance. Visible from the battlefield during the three Masters' stalemate. Seen in return by those who looked.
4. **The Ipadora Atrocities (901 ACC)** — Appeared above a burning settlement during Fradan war crimes against Ipadoran civilians. The killing in that settlement paused. Fluffy left. Suppressed from Fradan official records; survives in Ipadoran oral tradition with complicated bitterness.
5. **The Northern Earthquake (957 ACC)** — Appeared above the Jagged Mountains during an anomalous sustained tremor. Stationary for approximately three minutes. Gone.
