summary: "The most powerful entity in Criozevan. Power Rank #0. A Meta — the only category above the five power classes. Nothing confirmed about appearance, motivation, or current location."
---

**Fluffy** holds Power Rank #0 in Criozevan's informal power hierarchy. This rank exists for only one entity. The designation *Meta* was created because every other classification failed to accommodate what Fluffy represents — a level of power that operates above the laws and limitations that govern even god-tier practitioners and Arashi members.

What is known about Fluffy is almost nothing confirmed. The name itself is reported secondhand — those who have encountered Fluffy and survived to file any coherent account are few enough to count, and their accounts diverge in almost every particular except one: the experience was unlike anything else they had encountered, and their existing frameworks for understanding power were insufficient to process it.

Whether Fluffy has goals, allegiances, or a coherent agenda is debated by every organization with the resources to have the debate. The consensus is that standard organizational logic does not apply — Fluffy is not pursuing resources, territory, or influence by any recognized method. Whether this means Fluffy's goals are entirely alien, entirely absent, or simply invisible to the scale at which organizations operate is unresolved.

The **Crimson Knight** (Power Rank #2) is the one figure in Criozevan believed to have had meaningful contact with Fluffy and discussed it coherently afterward. He has declined to explain what that means for anyone else's safety.
