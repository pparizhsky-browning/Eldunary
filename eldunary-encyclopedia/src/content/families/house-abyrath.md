**Full Name:** House Abyrath (a cadet branch of House Nereval, the Ipadora royal family).

**Location:** Glaril — the largest underwater city, connected to Neruvalis, hub of underwater technology and the primary concentration of fish-type races in Criozevan.

**Head:** Prince Vaelen, younger brother of Queen Nayele.

## Establishment

When Queen Nayele came into power in **996 ACC** following her father's death, one of her first acts was to formally separate Glaril's governance into a distinct ruling branch and appoint her brother Vaelen to lead it. The decision was personal as much as political — she trusted him more than anyone, and she believed his particular qualities of temperament suited Glaril's complex and diverse population better than a bureaucratic appointment would.

## Status

Operates under Ipadora's broader political umbrella but governs Glaril with significant autonomy. House Abyrath's relationship to the main Nereval line is cooperative rather than subordinate in practice, owing to Vaelen and Nayele's close personal bond.
