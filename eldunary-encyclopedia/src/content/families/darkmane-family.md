Location: Warring Darkmane Realm.

Once unified the dark elf realm under their rule. Internal corruption split the family — some members became The Fallen (dark-magic-possessed husks), triggering societal collapse.

## The Betrayal of Vaelith the Hollow *(937 ACC)*

The event that destroyed the Darkmane Family's unity was the act of **Vaelith the Hollow** — head of the family from 896 to 938 ACC. Over his years of rule, Vaelith accepted payment from criminal organizations to allow experiments in the forest, keeping these arrangements hidden from the rest of the family.

In **937 ACC**, the Goldhelm Kingdom's head scientist approached Vaelith with a specific request: access to one of the ancient ruins inside the realm, and a Darkmane Elf to serve as a subject. Vaelith accepted. He ordered his own brother — **Thalrith the Wise** — to be kidnapped and handed over. The rest of the family was not informed.

The next night, a scream was heard from inside the Hidden Royal Palace. It came from **Luthyrra the Silent**, Thalrith's wife. Before dawn, both Thalrith and Luthyrra left their room together, their eyes holding a strange purple glow. Neither spoke. They walked into the deep forest and were never seen again. They were the first of the Fallen.

When the other family branches learned what Vaelith had done, they removed him from leadership immediately. The fracture that followed could not be contained. Between 938 and 940 ACC, the branches turned on each other in cascading recriminations. By **940 ACC**, the unified Darkmane Realm was over. What remained were the scattered warring tribes.

**Notable Figures:**  
- **Vaelith the Hollow** — former head (896–938 ACC), architect of the family's destruction. Sael's grandfather.  
- **Sael** — leader of the main branch warrior order, granddaughter of Vaelith, known for brokering protection deals with travelers crossing the Realm — and for seeking to reunify the Darkmane as a single kingdom once again.
