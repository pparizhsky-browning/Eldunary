The **Darkmane Family** is less a ruling dynasty than a lineage that has been present at every significant Darkmane cultural turning point — the original corruption of the rune practices that produced the Fallen Way, the schisms that fragmented the Darkmane Realm into its current tribal warband structure, and the ongoing negotiation between factions that produces the temporary peace frameworks the Realm occasionally achieves.

The **Warring Darkmane Realm** has no central government, which means the Family has no throne to govern from. What they have instead is historical authority — the weight of being the bloodline that other Darkmane clans reference when they need a mediating tradition — and the individual capabilities of their two most notable current members. **Vaelith the Hollow** and **Azaraith** are the practical embodiment of the family's influence, and their relationship defines more about Darkmane political reality than any governance document.

The Family's relationship to the **Fallen Way** — the corrupted rune tradition that defines Darkmane culture and was itself corrupted during a period of Family involvement — is complex. They are the tradition's primary custodians by lineage and its most capable practitioners by assessed power. Whether this makes them responsible for its consequences, capable of redirecting it, or simply its most visible expression is the internal debate that has never fully resolved.

Their **Adlens peace treaty** representation — Vaelith's tacit permission for the neutral town's existence — is the most visible current Family diplomatic stance. It is not a formal endorsement of peace; it is the absence of opposition to a framework that the Family finds, for now, preferable to the alternative.
