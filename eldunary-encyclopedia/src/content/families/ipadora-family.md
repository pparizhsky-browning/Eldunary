Rules the Ipadora Kingdom. The matriarchal structure of Ipadoran society means that the throne passes through the female line — a man may hold significant power within the family, but the primary seat of rule belongs to the senior woman of the ruling line.

A separate branch of the family — **House Abyrath** — governs Glaril, the largest underwater city, under an arrangement established by Queen Nayele upon her ascension. House Abyrath is led by Prince Vaelen, Nayele's younger brother.

**Notable Figures:**  
- **Queen Nayele of the Tide** — current head of House Nereval, Queen of the Ipadora Kingdom.  
- **Prince Vaelen of House Abyrath** — governor of Glaril, younger brother of Nayele.
