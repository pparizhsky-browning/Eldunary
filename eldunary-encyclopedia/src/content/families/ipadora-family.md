The **Ipadora Family** has governed the underwater kingdom for as long as the kingdom has had recorded history — which, given the Ipadora's meticulous record-keeping in their deep ocean archives, means longer than most surface civilizations can trace their own continuity. The family does not rule by conquest or by magic-enforced authority; it rules because the Ipadora cultural framework considers the family's governance inseparable from the Deep Mother's blessing, and because three generations of competent rulers have validated that framework's practical outcomes.

**Queen Nayele** is the family's current head and the most widely known Ipadora figure in Criozevan's surface world. Her direct governance produces **Ipadora Sanctuary's** exceptional civilian welfare metrics. The branch of the family governing **Glaril** operates with more latitude and considerably less pastoral success — the city's piracy problem is the family's most visible governance failure, and the Glaril branch has chosen to accommodate rather than resolve it.

**Rabuka (#4 Arashi)** is a distant family member — far enough in the family tree that his individual choices do not reflect on the family's governance directly, but close enough that Queen Nayele is aware of his existence, his path, and his current rank in the Arashi. The nature of their understanding has not been disclosed publicly. The absence of Ipadora action against Rabuka despite his Arashi affiliation is noted in intelligence analyses and not explained by official sources.

The family's political philosophy prioritizes stability, hospitality, and the long view — a philosophy that produces exceptional outcomes in the Sanctuary and produces the Glaril situation as its failure mode, because the hospitality principle's limit is the point where it enables ongoing harm rather than preventing it.
