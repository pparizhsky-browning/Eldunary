## The Devourer Bloodline

The Goldhelm royal line carries a hereditary Devourer ability — the capacity to passively absorb magic from living sources. This ability was the true cause of the founding exodus from the Folkwynd, the establishment of the anti-magic ban, and the development of holotech. The ability has diluted across generations of non-use; most modern members of the line carry only trace amounts. Seraphina is the first full re-expression of the ability in centuries. No living member of the family knows this history. See: The Goldhelm Exodus (History) and Devourers (Magi Types).
