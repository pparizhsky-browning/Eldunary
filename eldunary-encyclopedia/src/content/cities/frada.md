summary: "The Glass Bastion. Military republic capital. Grid-street city built for logistics. Senate sits here. Universal military service required of all citizens."
---

**Frada** was designed by generals, and it shows. The street grid is perfectly perpendicular. Every district is numbered. Every building has a fire lane, a backup access route, and a load-bearing specification carved into its foundation stone. In Frada, there are no charming winding alleys. There are thoroughfares, avenues, and service routes — all purpose-built.

The centerpiece is the **Glass Bastion**: Frada's military headquarters, senate chamber, and the symbolic heart of republic governance. Its walls are polished white stone with inlaid glass panels that catch morning light and cast it across the central parade ground. Senate debates happen in the amphitheater ring at the Bastion's crown — open to the public, proceedings recorded verbatim.

**Universal Service** is the law: every Frada citizen regardless of gender, race, or origin serves two years in the military before taking any other profession. This produces a civilian population that moves with military-acquired habits — economy of movement, clear communication, no sentiment wasted. Frada soldiers are competent everywhere; Frada veterans are assets that every organization recruits quietly after their service ends.

**Holotech** is Frada's primary export to the rest of Criozevan — its engineers adapted Goldhelm-originated technology into manufacturable formats after the Golden War. The export trade and the military budget are Frada's twin economic engines, and the Senate's debates almost always circle back to the balance between them.
