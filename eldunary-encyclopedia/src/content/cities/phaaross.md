summary: "Bridge city between Nikolem and Vacron. Strong Golem military presence. Critical trade hub between northwest and northeast."
---

**Phaaross** is the most strategically important city in the Nikolem Kingdom precisely because it faces outward: a bridge city at the eastern border, with a stone wall facing Vacron and watchtowers providing visibility in all directions. The Golem military presence here is significant and visible — not aggressive, but unmistakably there.

The city was built to connect northwest and northeast Criozevan trade routes, and it performs this function effectively: merchants from the Goldhelm Kingdom and Darkmane Realm pass east through Phaaross into Vacron's trade network, and goods from Vacron and beyond flow west. The Golems charge appropriate tolls and enforce commercial protocol with the same thoroughness they apply to everything.

The wall facing Vacron is a notable architectural statement — not hostile exactly, but clear: this is where Nikolem ends and Vacron begins, and the line is not negotiable. Commercial travelers are processed at the gate. Everyone else is politely but firmly questioned.
