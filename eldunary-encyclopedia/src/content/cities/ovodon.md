*The Gilded Cradle doesn't invite you in. It looms. Its towers catch the light and throw it back like a warning.*

**Ovodon** is the political seat, military command post, and ideological heart of the Goldhelm Kingdom — three functions the city performs simultaneously and without visible effort. Every architectural decision communicates the same message: this is a place of order, precision, and authority that does not require your approval to exist.

The **Gilded Cradle** dominates the skyline — a castle of holo-gilded stone engineered to be visible from every approach. It is not purely decorative: its walls incorporate layered holo-tech defensive systems, and the tower positions are calibrated for maximum field-of-fire coverage. The royal family lives here. King Aldric rules from here. Princess Seraphina's presence is felt though rarely publicly confirmed.

Ovodon is a large city by any standard, but its streets feel curiously empty to those accustomed to the chaos of Vacron or Fodon. Citizens move with purpose, dressed in the correct attire for their social tier. Outsiders stand out immediately — not just culturally but structurally: the city's citizen-ID system flags unregistered individuals, and the Auric Vanguard maintains visible patrols in foreign-facing districts.

The city is not merely hostile to outsiders. It is *designed* to be hostile to outsiders: minimal signage in Common, officials who respond slowly or not at all to queries in non-Solaran languages, merchant districts that quietly raise prices for identified foreigners, and an accommodation system that requires sponsorship from a Goldhelm citizen to access.

A heavily fortified river divides the kingdom: Ovodon to the north, Ibeson to the south. Controlled crossings mean entry requires documentation. The ocean surrounds the city on most sides — natural moats that the kingdom has supplemented with maritime defenses.
