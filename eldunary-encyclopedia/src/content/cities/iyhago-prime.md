summary: "The Sanctum Spiral. The Quiet Harmonic theocracy's capital, built on the island of Vehalo. Three sacred bridges connect it to outer districts. Veles, Master of Magic, resides here."
---

The island of **Vehalo** rises from the lake that occupies the center of Iyhago's mainland like a crown from still water. **Iyhago Prime** covers every inch of Vehalo, arranged in the **Sanctum Spiral**: concentric rings of stone buildings ascending toward the island's peak, where the Radiant Sanctum stands, its glass-domed observation cupola visible from the mainland shore on clear days.

Three **Sacred Bridges** connect Vehalo to the mainland districts: the Bridge of Listening (scholars and students), the Bridge of Offering (merchants and pilgrims), and the Bridge of Counsel (diplomats, organization representatives, and those with appointments to see the Quiet Harmonic's inner circle). Crossing the wrong bridge for your purpose is considered an insult, though the consequence is merely a polite redirection — Iyhago Prime is not given to harsh enforcement.

**Veles, Master of Magic**, lives in the upper Spiral in a tower that appears to be a different size from outside than it is inside. He holds audience three times each week. Scholars travel from across Criozevan to spend an hour in his study. He speaks **Kōtoba** by preference, with other languages used only when diplomacy demands it.

The **Butterfly** organization has its deepest ideological alignment here — Iyhago Prime's philosophy of magical balance mirrors Butterfly's own principles. Rose maintains formal diplomatic presence. The Magic Societies hold their governing councils in the lower Spiral twice yearly. For those who practice magic and wish to understand it, Iyhago Prime is the center of the world.
