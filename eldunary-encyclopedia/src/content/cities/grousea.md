*Three kinds of business happen in Grousea: illegal, extralegal, and the kind that kills you for asking what category it falls into.*

**Grousea** is not an official capital — the Warring Darkmane Realm lacks a government capable of conferring such designations — but it functions as one through sheer critical mass. The largest permanent dark elf settlement, the highest concentration of criminal infrastructure, and the de facto meeting point for anyone with business in the realm: Grousea is the capital whether or not anyone put it on a map.

Dark elves from every clan pass through Grousea at some point. The city's commercial instinct is pure: if you have something to sell, someone will buy it. Information brokers, poison merchants, assassins-for-hire, artifact dealers, and debt collectors share streets without formal regulation, operating under the informal law of *whoever is stronger today*. This shifts more often than any calendar.

**Vaelith the Hollow** is associated with Grousea — the most notable living member of the fractured Darkmane Family, present in the city with purposes she hasn't disclosed to anyone who has survived the disclosure.

Outsiders entering Grousea do so at significant personal risk and are advised to arrive with either a local sponsor or demonstrable power. Those with neither are typically robbed before they reach the second street intersection.

The city itself is architecturally impressive in a disturbing way: dark elf construction integrated into the ancient forest's canopy, buildings grown around tree trunks rather than next to them, shadow-paths that only make sense if you can see in near-darkness. It is beautiful the way a trap is beautiful.
