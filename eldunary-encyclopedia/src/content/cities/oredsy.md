Every significant question in **Oredsy** — political succession, governance disputes, trade contract negotiations, criminal sentences, honor claims — can by law be resolved by combat. The **Fereltharn Arena** hosts public dueling seven days a week. Morning sessions are for civic disputes. Afternoon sessions are exhibition bouts by the republic's ranked sword practitioners. Evening sessions, by invitation and betting, feature the arena's own masters.

**Selvarin, Master of Swords**, lives in the upper city in a residence that has no locked doors. His philosophy, and Oredsy's by extension, holds that skill demonstrated openly invites honest challenge, and that only the kind of challenge worth having comes from those who know the full measure of what they face. He has not lost a duel in recorded history.

The **Tower of Vaelrin** stands at the city's center — a memorial to the swordsman who held the eastern gate alone for three days during the First Great War while the republic's army regrouped. The tower's base is inscribed with names of those who fell with him. The top is open to the sky, where Oredsy's traditional practice of releasing white birds on the republic's founding day originates.

**Pegasus** controls Oredsy with a light hand — the republic's genuine sword-meritocracy produces the kind of competent, direct-dealing population that Pegasus finds useful. The control is less visible tyranny than genuine alignment of values: both Oredsy and Pegasus believe in ability deciding outcomes. The Free Assembly continues to govern visible republic operations while Pegasus handles the strategic layer.
