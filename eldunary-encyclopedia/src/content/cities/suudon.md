*The mist over Suudon is not weather. It is the exhalation of the rune veins in the soil, the accumulated magical discharge of a city built on concentrated power.*

**Suudon** is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Criozevan — not because it was the first settlement built, but because the **Golem King** was here before anyone built anything, and the city grew around his presence over centuries. The Golem Swamp that surrounds it is chemically and magically unusual: the water conducts ambient rune energy at measurable levels, the plant life bioluminesces at night, and the mist that never fully clears has a way of obscuring navigation that suggests intention rather than weather.

Non-Golems who visit Suudon describe a persistent feeling of being watched, evaluated, and found neither threatening nor particularly interesting. It is not hostile, but it is profoundly indifferent to the comfort of anyone who isn't stone.

A vast underground network is rumored to extend beneath the Great Lake near the city. A complete underground city — populated, functional, and entirely off any published map — is rumored to exist below Suudon's foundations. No outsider has confirmed this. The Golems who know do not discuss it with non-Golems.

**Nebbio (#3 Arashi)**, the Assassin of the Mist, operates from Suudon — perhaps the only Arashi member whose location of operations is so brazen as to be almost a challenge to the Golem King's claimed sovereignty.
