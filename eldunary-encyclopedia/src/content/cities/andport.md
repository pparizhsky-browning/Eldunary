summary: "Iyhago's western gate and primary trade hub. The famous bridge to Frada. Ritual oath-walking tradition. Spector (#11 Arashi) based here."
---

**Andport** sits at the western edge of Iyhago's territory, where the kingdom's coastline meets the sea crossing toward Frada. It is the natural gathering point for traders coming from the western republics — goods from Frada and the coastal kingdoms pass through Andport before they reach Iyhago's interior markets, and Iyhago's magical crafts flow outward through the same gates.

The **Bridge to Frada** is the city's greatest engineering achievement and its greatest vulnerability — the only fixed crossing that connects east and west Criozevan at this latitude. The bridge has been destroyed twice in history and rebuilt twice at enormous cost. It is now defended so heavily that attacking it is considered among the worst military decisions any commander could make.

**Oath-Walking** is Andport's signature civic ritual: any significant agreement signed in the city is formalized by the parties walking the bridge's full span together, speaking the terms aloud into the sea wind, which Andport's tradition holds carries words to witnesses who cannot be called as mortals. Foreign merchants find it time-consuming. Andport citizens find its absence unsettling.

**Spector (#11 Arashi)** uses Andport as a base of operations — he is the only Arashi member with a known fixed location who does not seem to consider his presence there a secret. Whether this is confidence, indifference, or a calculated message to those who might wish to find him has been debated extensively among the organizations that monitor such things.
