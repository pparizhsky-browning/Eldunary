summary: "The gateway between Akison's main island and the Criozevan mainland. Heavy customs inspection. Engineer guilds run the bridge mechanisms."
---

**Okbridge** exists for one purpose: to be the gate between Akison's island and everything else. It does this function with extraordinary thoroughness. If you are bringing anything into or out of Akison that could be considered a material, substance, weapon, animal, plant, magical artifact, or document of strategic value, you will spend time in Okbridge — possibly a lot of time.

The **Engineer Guilds** of Okbridge built the bridge mechanisms and retain operational control of the bridge sections, drawbridges, lock gates, and water barriers. In practice, this means the guilds have leverage over every government that needs to move goods through Okbridge, which they exercise with scrupulous fairness and a standardized fee schedule that has not changed in forty years.

**Crimson Rooks** maintain a customs enforcement office here. **Ace** maintains a shadow presence watching what the Rooks flag and, more importantly, what they wave through. The customs inspection theater has three layers that most merchants never notice: the official inspection, the unofficial inspection, and the observation of both by parties none of them can see.

The bridge itself is a feat of engineering — a double-level road and rail crossing over deep channel water, wide enough for four cargo wagons abreast, with mechanical counterweights that can raise the central span in seventy seconds flat.
