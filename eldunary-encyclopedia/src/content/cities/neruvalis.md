summary: "The Disappearing City. Submerged partially during high tide. Sea-gate port to the underwater city of Glaril. The only reliable connection point to Ipadora waters."
---

At high tide, the lower third of **Neruvalis** is underwater. This is not an engineering failure — it is an intentional design rooted in the city's function as Criozevan's primary transit point between the surface world and the underwater civilization of *Glaril*. The buildings are built from water-tolerant stone, coated with tidal-resistance shellac, and designed with drainage slopes that clear the streets within two hours of tide receding.

The city's most important feature is the **Sea-Gate**: a reinforced underwater arch that marks the official entry to Ipadora-controlled waters below. Ipadora merchants surface here regularly through pressurization chambers built into the dock pilings. The exchange of goods — surface dried goods, preserved foods, and metals for Ipadora seafloor minerals and water-plant medicines — is the engine of Neruvalis's economy.

Locals divide the city into **High Neruvalis** (always above water, perpetually busy) and **Low Neruvalis** (tidal zone, populated only by those who know the tide schedule and don't mind wet boots). High Neruvalis is dense with storehouses, auctions, and shipping offices. Low Neruvalis has the oldest taverns, the best sea-food, and the most private meeting rooms.

**Rose** operates a relay station here, serving as the only organization with formal diplomatic standing with both Akison's Iron Path and the Ipadora Kingdom simultaneously.
