**Skellmoor** does not have a country. It does not have a government. It does not have laws, courts, police, or a census. What it has is **engines** — enormous, perpetually maintained steam and holotech hybrid engines that keep the entire city aloft above the clouds, and the collective self-interest of every person on it to keep those engines running, because if they stop, everyone on Skellmoor becomes a ballistics problem.

The city began as a salvage platform — a collection of decommissioned warships and industrial platforms bolted together after the First Great War for scrap processing. At some point, the people working on it found it preferable to their lives below, added more platforms, installed more engines, and stopped going back down. That was three generations ago. The platform has been growing ever since.

**No laws** in the philosophical sense is balanced by the **Skellmoor Social Contract** in the practical sense: nothing that threatens the engines is tolerated. Nothing that threatens the platform stability is tolerated. Beyond those two prohibitions, the city's population of exiles, criminals, political refugees, technical geniuses, black market operators, and people who simply could not function under anyone else's rules works out its conflicts by negotiation, reputation, and occasional demonstration of individual capability.

The **technology black market** here is the most frontier of Criozevan's shadow trade: experimental holotech prototypes, stolen Goldhelm research equipment, Butterfly-monitored spell matrices with their monitoring removed, and weapons that can't be discussed in countries with extradition agreements with anyone. Multiple Arashi members have used Skellmoor as a staging ground, a storage location, or an emergency refuge. Nobody asks them to leave.
