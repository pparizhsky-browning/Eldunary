summary: "A floating steampunk city suspended above the cloud layer over the northern sea. Permanently invisible. No laws — governed by competing interests, informal contracts, and mutual deterrence. Home to the most comprehensive technology black market on the continent. Officially: does not exist. The Crimson Rooks have investigated seven times and confirmed nothing."

Skellmoor does not appear on any map. It is not recognized by any continental government, monitored by the Crimson Rooks, or acknowledged in any official diplomatic record. To most people in Criozevan, it is an urban legend — a story told in port taverns, usually by someone who knows someone who claims to have been there, never by someone who will admit to having been there themselves. The Crimson Rooks have investigated Skellmoor as a concept seven times across the past three centuries and concluded, each time, that no such location has been confirmed to exist.

It exists.

## Location & Access

Skellmoor is a floating city, suspended above the cloud layer over the northern sea. It is permanently invisible — not from a distance, but from any distance. The invisibility is magical in origin, layered and maintained by the city's own population across generations, and it is complete enough that Skellmoor cannot be seen from below the clouds, from within the clouds, or from above them, unless you already know precisely where it is and how to approach it. Citizens and approved visitors navigate to it using memorized coordinates, specific ascent routes, and signal sequences that have never been written down in any form that could be found.

## The City

The city itself is a steampunk island — built on a mass of levitating stone and compressed earth, held aloft by a combination of ancient magic embedded into the rock and engineering that has been modified and rebuilt so many times that no single person understands how all of it works. The architecture is dense and layered: buildings stack on buildings, connected by catwalks, cable cars, and pneumatic lifts. Steam vents from nearly every surface. The aesthetic is one of perpetual mechanical improvisation — nothing was built to look like anything in particular, only to function, and function it does, in the chaotic and self-correcting way that cities built by people who answer to no one tend to.

## Laws & Governance

Skellmoor has no laws. Not suspended laws, not unenforced laws — no laws. What it has instead is a functional ecosystem of competing interests, informal contracts, mutual deterrence, and the shared understanding that destroying the city's secrecy is the one thing everyone who lives there has a reason to prevent. Criminals from every kingdom on the continent have established operations in Skellmoor, and the city's technology black market — gadgets, curiosities, stolen holotech components, banned magical artifacts — is the most comprehensive on the continent precisely because no inspector has ever set foot on it.

The Crimson Rooks know that Skellmoor is probably real. They have never been able to prove it, reach it, or infiltrate it. This fact is not discussed in their public reports.
