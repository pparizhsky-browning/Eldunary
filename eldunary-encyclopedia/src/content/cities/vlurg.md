summary: "The black market capital. Town built around its central market. Elves speak Nualthyr when they prefer not to be understood."

*Everything is for sale in Vlurg. The question is never "can I buy this?" but "do I trust the person selling it?"*

**Vlurg** is defined entirely by its market. The town grew from a trading post into a permanent settlement because the market was too valuable to abandon, and the market is too valuable to abandon because it is where items that cannot be legitimately traded anywhere on Criozevan appear and change hands without legal consequence.

The dark elf population shifts between Common and Nualthyr mid-conversation based on whether they want to be understood — a practice so ingrained that outsiders negotiating in Vlurg should assume that anything said in Nualthyr after they make an offer is a detailed assessment of how to take advantage of them.

The market operates in a permanent grey zone: technically outside any kingdom's enforcement jurisdiction (the Darkmane Realm has no enforcement apparatus), practically protected by the mutual interest of everyone who uses it. Disrupting Vlurg's commerce would harm too many powerful interests across too many factions for any single party to attempt it.

Artifact dealers here deal in corrupted rune fragments, pre-war Tharnex carapace glyphs, Goldhelm contraband tech, and items of unclear provenance that carry prices calibrated to the desperation of the buyer.
