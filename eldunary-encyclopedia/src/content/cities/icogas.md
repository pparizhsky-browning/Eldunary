**Icogas** was a city once. The ruins of that city still stand, and people still inhabit them, but the designation of *city* is applied generously. What Icogas is, more accurately, is a **persistent magical anomaly** centered on an ancient nexus site where multiple Runestone field lines intersect and have intersected since before recorded history.

The magic field here does not behave predictably. Spells cast at Icogas produce results larger, stranger, and more uncontrollable than their casters intend. Malefici practitioners who come here report abilities that exceed their normal limits — and injuries they could not have predicted. Objects left in Icogas overnight sometimes have new properties in the morning. Sometimes they do not exist in the morning.

**Butterfly** maintains monitoring stations at four points around the city's perimeter, measuring field intensity and reporting anomalies to the Magic Societies. They operate on a rotation because no researcher has been able to tolerate the posting for more than six months consecutively without reporting significant perceptual effects.

**Dark Paladin (#1 Arashi)** lives in Icogas by choice. This is the single most alarming fact known about the most powerful ranked villain in Criozevan. What he does there, what he studies, what the site's power does for or to someone of his strength — no investigator who has gotten close enough to observe has returned with the capacity to file a complete report.
