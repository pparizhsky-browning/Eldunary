summary: "Hidden dark elf warrior training ground. Shielded by magic. No trade — only forges, shrines, and poison-makers."
---

*You will not find Wrediff unless a dark elf allows you to find it. The magic that shields the town actively confuses navigation — trails that appear direct double back, forest landmarks shift, and the ambient spell-fog makes compasses unreliable.*

**Wrediff** exists to produce warriors. That is its entire purpose. No markets, no civilian commerce, no accommodation for travelers. There are forges (highly advanced, producing blades and poisons of exceptional quality), shrines where ancestral spirits are consulted through blood-rite rituals, and poison-makers who have refined their craft over generations in isolation.

The locals speak only Nualthyr. This is not cultural preference — it is policy. Wrediff does not accept Common-speaking visitors. The presence of a foreigner is itself considered a security failure, and the appropriate response is investigation rather than hospitality.

The warriors trained here form the most disciplined military units among dark elves — not because Wrediff produces the most powerful individuals, but because the training emphasizes collective doctrine, coordination, and patience that individual combat-hungry elves often lack. Fighting a Wrediff-trained unit is fighting an opponent who has been practicing in silence for years.
