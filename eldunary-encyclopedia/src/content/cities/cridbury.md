summary: "Mountain foothills mining town. Famous for rare minerals. Outsiders get 'lost' in tunnels without Golem guides."
---

Built into the foothills of the **Jagged Mountains**, **Cridbury** is where Criozevan's most prized construction materials come from: dense stone alloys, rune-reactive crystals, and mineral composites unavailable anywhere else. Golems and hired miners work together here, with the Golems providing both physical labor and the expertise to navigate a tunnel system that would kill an unguided outsider.

That last point is not metaphorical. The Cridbury tunnels extend deep into the mountain range, branching and rejoining in patterns that make intuitive navigation impossible. Outsiders who enter without a Golem guide *get lost*. The Golems are aware this happens. They are available as guides for a fee.

As a training center for heavy weapon users, Cridbury attracts warriors from across Criozevan willing to pay for access to Golem-crafted gear and the facility's combat chambers carved into the mountain rock. The training here produces the heaviest combatants on the continent — not the most skilled, but those with the most raw, crushing force.
