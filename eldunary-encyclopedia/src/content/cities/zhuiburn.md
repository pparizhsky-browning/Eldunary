summary: "Perpetual flames from volcanic vents. Hostile to outsiders. Pyrrhith language spoken exclusively. Lucifer (#6 Arashi) was born here. The city where the Crimson Convergence's most destructive phase began."

The **volcanic vent network** beneath Zhuiburn has burned for longer than the city has existed. The vents were active before the First Great War, before the republic, before the Arashi, before any era that documented records reach. Zhuiburn was built around them — forges, kilns, heat-treatment workshops, and the communal fire-houses that serve as Zhuiburn's social institutions are all vent-powered, running at temperatures manufacturing cities elsewhere achieve only with extraordinary fuel costs.

The city speaks **Pyrrhith** exclusively. It is a language of hard consonants and breath management — necessary for people who live in smoke and heat — and it is spoken nowhere else on Criozevan with the same native fluency. Visiting Zhuiburn without knowing Pyrrhith is not illegal, but the social consequences are equivalent: nothing will be explained to you, nothing will be repeated, and whether your confusion is treated with amusement or irritation depends entirely on whether you made the effort to prepare.

**Lucifer (#6 Arashi)** was born in Zhuiburn and carries the city's temperament in every action: total in intent, indifferent to collateral cost, incapable of half-measures. His destruction of Fodon's leadership structure was not planned in a war room — it was carried out with the methodical efficiency of a furnace worker who has identified the precise fuel load required for a specific temperature.

The city's hostility to outsiders is not performative. Zhuiburn simply has no patience for those who cannot withstand its conditions, and views their inability to do so as information about their worth.
