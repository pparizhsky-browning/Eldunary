summary: "The rare peaceful settlement in the Darkmane Realm. Dark elves who reject violence, defector Golems, and refugee Goldhelms coexist here."
---

*Adlens is proof that it's possible, even in the Warring Darkmane Realm, to choose peace. The choice is just expensive and requires very good security.*

**Adlens** stands in striking contrast to every other settlement in the Warring Darkmane Realm: diverse, peaceful, openly trading, and accessible to outsiders. Its population is a coalition of three groups who share the quality of having rejected something:

- **Dark elves who reject violence** — clan-exiles, pacifists, and elders who chose to withdraw rather than participate in the endless tribal conflicts.
- **Golems who defected from the Golem King** — a small but notable community who left the Nikolem Kingdom for reasons they largely decline to explain. They are watched from afar by their creator but not recalled by force.
- **Goldhelms who fled corruption** — exiles from the Goldhelm Kingdom, having violated the caste contract or refused participation in something the government preferred to keep quiet.

The **Ace** organization enforces rules here, hired by the local government — their masked, playing-card-marked members providing a neutral enforcement layer that no single faction could provide without triggering the others.

A large port makes Adlens a significant trade hub — the primary sea connection between the Goldhelm Kingdom and the southeast. A peace treaty between multiple factions was signed here at some point; the exact parties and terms are not publicly known, but the treaty has been honored, which is remarkable.
