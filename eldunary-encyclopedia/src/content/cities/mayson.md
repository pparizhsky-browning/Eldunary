summary: "Desert town. Many crypts beneath the town square. Residents do not excavate."
---

**Mayson** is a desert town east of Fodon — dry, functional, and built atop a crypt network so extensive that the town square occasionally sinks slightly during annual heat cycles as the earth below shifts. Residents have learned not to dig in the square. They have not investigated what is in the crypts. This is a position that has served the town well across generations.

The above-ground town is unremarkable by Fodon standards: desert architecture built for heat management, market and residential districts, basic services. The crypts below are the feature that makes Mayson notable to historians, treasure hunters, and people who study what happened in this region during the district wars — though the last group has had little luck obtaining access to anything below ground level.
