summary: "Desert canyon town with an underground city carved vertically into the cliff walls. Near where Vulkran's remains rest."
---

**Plodrough** is built both above and below ground — the surface town sits at the canyon rim while the underground city extends vertically into the cliffside, districts carved into the rock at different depths over centuries. Upper districts receive natural light; lower districts rely on rune-lit lanterns and the faint heat-glow of geothermal fissures.

The canyon walls preserve the history of the Fire District war in scorched stone: black blast patterns, molten-glass formations from volcanic attacks, sections of the rock face that were literally melted and refrozen into new shapes. The ruins near the canyon floor below are acknowledged as the resting place of **Vulkran's** remains — still warm, locals say, even after all this time. The warmth is measurable. No one has provided a satisfying explanation.
