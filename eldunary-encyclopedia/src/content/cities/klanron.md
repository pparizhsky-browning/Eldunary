*Walk into Klanron and you'll feel it before you see it: a pressure at the back of your sinuses, a warmth behind your eyes, the sense that the air itself is slightly more alive than it should be. That's 90% of the population exerting ambient magical field effects simply by existing here.*

**Klanron** sits on a peninsula between two rivers and functions as the designated meeting place and community hub for every **Magic Society** in Criozevan. The **Butterfly** organization maintains its headquarters here, conducting its work of fighting corruption and helping alliances between magic communities.

The city is friendly to visitors — genuinely so, not tactically. Magic practitioners tend toward the philosophical, and philosophical people are generally curious about newcomers. That friendliness has a limit: non-magic users who are simply visiting are fine, but those who attempt to establish permanent residence find their applications mysteriously delayed, their license requests lost in bureaucracy, and the ambient magical field increasingly uninviting.

The Magic Societies meeting hall is the largest structure in the city — a circular chamber with seating for representatives from every kingdom, positioned so that no faction has a positional advantage. Debates here can run for weeks. The Societies' collective influence on Criozevan's magical policy is significant and deeply underappreciated by the kingdoms that nominally govern them.
