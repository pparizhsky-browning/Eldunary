summary: "Peaceful Golem forest town. Few rules, few visitors. Famous for strange glowing plants at night."
---

**Klosdon** is the quietest settlement in the Nikolem Kingdom and possibly in all of Criozevan — a forest rest stop in the central part of the kingdom where Golems live without the weight of mountain mining or swamp politics. Few rules, fewer visitors, almost no commerce. The Golems here appear to have chosen this location because they wanted to be left alone, and the decision has been respected.

The glowing plants are the town's only tourist draw: at night, the forest around Klosdon illuminates in slow, pulsing blues and golds as vegetation that has grown near rune-rich soil absorbs ambient magical energy during the day and releases it as bioluminescence after dark. The effect is spectacular. It is also slightly disorienting, and visitors who don't know to stay on marked paths at night sometimes get confused by the shifting light patterns and wander off.

The Golems find this mildly interesting and entirely not their problem.
