Where Frada is the brain of the republic, **Hiypolis** is its fist. The city sits on Frada's southern coast, facing open water, built around the **Holo-Tech Forge Docks** — the largest holotech manufacturing facility in Criozevan. Giant forge-barns line the waterfront, each capable of building an armored ship from keel to launch in six weeks. The smoke they produce smells of copper and ozone and hangs over the bay in a permanent ochre haze.

The **War College** trains Frada's officer class: strategists, naval commanders, siege engineers, and the special operations branch that is never officially acknowledged. The College's library holds tactical records from every major conflict since the First Great War, organized by engagement type, terrain, and adversary. Students are expected to read all of it.

**Ipadora proximity** gives Hiypolis its secondary role: diplomacy staging point. Ipadora Sanctuary is accessible from Hiypolis via a pressurization pathway that Ipadora maintains, making it the most common entry point for surface diplomats visiting the underwater kingdom. Frada and Ipadora maintain a formal military non-aggression treaty, which is renewed in Hiypolis every ten years.

Non-military visitors to Hiypolis require a Frada government sponsor. The locals are used to outsiders — they are not used to tolerating them long.
