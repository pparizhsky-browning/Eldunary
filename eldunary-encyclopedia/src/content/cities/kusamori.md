summary: "Built on platforms above an ancient canopy. Specializes in medicine, herbs, and poisons. Connected by tram. Most educated healers in Criozevan trained here."
---

The forest floor of Kusamori's ancient grove has not seen direct sunlight in recorded history. The canopy is so dense, so old, that the entire city — platforms, bridges, market stalls, residences, and research towers — was built above it. The forest below is a mystery that plant scholars are still mapping by descent-rope.

**Kusamori's specialty is life chemistry**: medicine, herbal remedies, poisons, antidotes, stimulants, preservatives. The city's apothecaries are the most credentialed in Criozevan, and its graduate healers staff hospitals across the continent. Even nations with complicated relationships with Akison quietly license Kusamori-trained physicians.

The **tram network** of horizontal platforms and diagonal cable-cars connects the city's scattered platform clusters. Passengers ride in open-sided wooden cars that swing gently through the canopy ceiling. The morning journey from the East Research Platform to the Market Platform takes eleven minutes and passes through clouds of spores that are entirely harmless, though they turn your hair faintly blue for a day.

**Ace** maintains a quiet presence here, studying herb supplies for field operations. The city has never chosen a side in Criozevan's political conflicts — its neutrality is enforced by the professional necessity of every armed faction: everyone needs medicine.
