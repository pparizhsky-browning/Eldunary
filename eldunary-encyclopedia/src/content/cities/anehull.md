summary: "Ghost town rebuilt into a war relic resort. Rose covert meetings. Crimson Rooks constant surveillance. Magic dampeners always active."
---

*Anehull is the only resort in Criozevan where every room is individually surveilled by a different organization. The locals have learned to regard this as an amenity.*

**Anehull** was a ghost town after an **Arashi** campaign leveled it. The practical outcome of that destruction was that the ruins became historically interesting, and historically interesting ruins are economically viable. The town was rebuilt with tourism as its explicit economic model: war relic tours through preserved battle sites, artifacts from the campaign available for purchase, guided walks through reconstructed district layouts.

The irony of this model is that Anehull is now one of the busiest small towns in Vacron while also being one of the most covertly contested. **Rose** leadership uses it for covert meetings — the flow of tourism traffic provides convenient cover for unmonitored gatherings. The **Crimson Rooks** maintain constant surveillance specifically because they know Rose uses it for meetings, but haven't managed to intercept a meaningful conversation yet.

**Magic dampeners** are permanently active throughout the town — a legacy of the post-Arashi reconstruction that was meant to be temporary and became permanent infrastructure. No magic can be cast in Anehull. This makes it the only significant population center in Vacron Kingdom where magic is effectively banned, which adds a dimension of irony given how many magic users pass through for covert Rose meetings.

Rumors of **hell malefici** sightings have circulated since the original Arashi campaign. The Crimson Rooks have not confirmed or denied them. The tourism industry has incorporated the rumors into paid nighttime tours.
