*Every road in Criozevan eventually leads to Vacron. This is not geography — it is economics.*

**Vacron** is the largest city on the continent of Criozevan, sitting precisely at the geographic center of the landmass where the continental trade routes converge. It functions as the economic heart of the known world: every major commercial transaction involving more than one kingdom eventually passes through Vacron's legal framework, trade registries, or physical infrastructure.

The **Crimson Rooks HQ** occupies a heavily fortified compound within the city — guarded by elite officers and comprehensive surveillance technology. Citizens view the Rooks with the complicated regard people universally hold for effective police in a well-ordered city: appreciated for the protection, slightly uncomfortable with the omnipresence.

The **Crimson Knight**, Criozevan's second most powerful being and the world's primary enforcer of order, resides in Vacron. The city's stability is inseparable from this fact — threats that might otherwise escalate to violence here generally don't, because the people contemplating violence calculate the Crimson Knight into the equation.

Law is strict and punishment is efficient. Outsiders are welcomed by default, monitored always, and treated fairly unless they break rules. The rules themselves are clear, public, and applied equally regardless of race or power. This is rare enough to be genuinely remarkable across Criozevan.

Population is extremely diverse: every race maintains a presence, every organization has at least one office, and the market districts reflect the full economic range of the continent. Vacron is the place to find something that can't be found anywhere else — and the Crimson Rooks are the reason you can probably buy it without being robbed on the way home.
