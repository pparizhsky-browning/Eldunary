*In Ibeson, every building is a lab and every lab has a basement that doesn't appear on any map.*

**Ibeson** is the scientific capital not just of the Goldhelm Kingdom but of all Criozevan — the concentration of research institutions, private laboratories, and government-funded experimental programs here exceeds any other city. The skyline is defined by towers with filtered glass windows, observation platforms, and emission stacks from contained experiments.

The public face of Ibeson is legitimately impressive: the *Department of Holometric Advancement* operates its largest campus here, advancing holotech year by year. Students from Frada (the only foreigners allowed extended stays) arrive on research exchange programs. Peer-reviewed findings are published and shared — selectively.

Beneath that public face, the Goldhelm government conducts experiments it has not disclosed to any council, including its own advisory sectors. **Kaboom** was created here — a being of pure explosive energy, engineered as a destructive weapon by government scientists, who escaped the facility and eventually joined the Arashi. **Helm** works here, his poison manipulation accident the product of exactly the kind of unregulated pharmaceutical experimentation the government denies.

Entry is easier than Ovodon for foreigners, but the monitoring is just as thorough. Fradan research visitors are processed, logged, and tracked during their stay. Research outputs are reviewed for strategic sensitivity before publication approval.

The Auric Vanguard presence here focuses less on military parade and more on quiet, pervasive observation. The lab coats and the armor are calibrated to coexist invisibly.
