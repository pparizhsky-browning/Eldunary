summary: "The largest underwater city in Criozevan. Ipadora family faction governs but piracy is rampant. Rabuka (#4 Arashi), the Shark warrior, makes his home here."
---

**Glaril** is larger than Ipadora Sanctuary but less peaceful, less orderly, and considerably more interesting to those who operate in the gray spaces between law and lawlessness. Where the Sanctuary is the kingdom's ideal, Glaril is its reality: a massive, sprawling underwater city with the full complexity of a large population, limited enforcement capacity, and a geographic position that makes it the natural transit hub for anything moving through Ipadora waters.

The **Ipadora family faction** that governs Glaril is a branch of the royal family — governing is an inherited administrative role, and the current branch is competent administrators who have made peace with their inability to control the city's waterfront. The Glaril waterfront is piracy's home, not in the romantic sense but in the functional sense: ships that come through Ipadora water routes pass near enough to Glaril that organized theft from maritime cargo is a stable economic activity.

**Rabuka (#4 Arashi)** lives in Glaril by origin and still maintains a residence here. He is Sharkai — a shark-person — and in Glaril, among the Ipadora and the waterfront population, he is known not as an Arashi member but as a talented fighter who grew up well. His reputation in Glaril is local, personal, and complicated. His reputation outside Glaril is the reason organizations with resources send experienced people before they send anyone else.

**Rose** maintains a diplomatic post. No other surface organization has managed to establish a stable presence.
