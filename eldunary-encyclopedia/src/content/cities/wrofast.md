summary: "Oredsy's primary maritime port. The metallic blue 'W'-emblazoned ships of Wrofast are the most distinctive merchant fleet in Criozevan. Sailor Speak originated here."
---

The harbor of **Wrofast** never empties. From before dawn until well after midnight, ships arrive and depart, dock workers move cargo, harbormaster staff update ledgers, and the metallic blue ships with the stylized **'W' emblem** of Wrofast's civic fleet slide in and out of berths with practiced efficiency. The fleet is the pride of the city and the symbol of Oredsy's claim to maritime power.

**Sailor Speak** — the pidgin trade language of the open sea — has its documented origins in Wrofast's harbor, where sailors from every race and nation converged and developed a workable communication system across language barriers. It has since spread to every port city in Criozevan. In Wrofast, it is still the dominant language of the waterfront at night, even among those who speak perfectly fluent common.

The city's maritime culture extends to its architecture: buildings along the harbor use ship-building techniques, with wooden frames pegged rather than nailed and curved joints designed to flex in seismic events. The upper city, away from the waterfront, is built more conventionally but keeps the same aesthetic — curved rooflines, porthole windows, rope-and-peg joinery in visible beam work.

The **Crimson Rooks** maintain a small presence here for customs and goods inspection. Pegasus operates through the shipping companies themselves, using maritime trade routes for intelligence transport across distances that would otherwise require slow land travel.
