summary: "Crimson Rooks outpost and the black market technology capital of Criozevan. Holotech components unavailable elsewhere flow through Ubraamore's shadow markets."
---

In strict law, **Ubraamore** is a Crimson Rooks-administered outpost on the eastern border of Iyhago, tasked with monitoring cross-border goods. In practice, it is the most important illegal technology market on the continent.

Holotech components — the ones Goldhelm bans from export, the ones Frada won't release to civilians, the ones that technically require a government license to own — move through Ubraamore in quantities that everyone with intelligence resources knows about and no one has successfully stopped. The Rooks here are not corrupt, precisely; they operate within a structured framework of official tolerance that is renewed informally every few years when the organization's leadership decides the intelligence value of monitoring Ubraamore's trade outweighs the value of suppressing it.

**Pegasus** has a shadow presence here specifically to monitor what technology is moving, to whom, and at what price. The shadow market in advanced holotech components tells a story about Criozevan's faction-level weapons programs that no official diplomatic report would ever contain.

The city's surface is unremarkable — standard Iyhago architecture, a large customs house, three officially registered trading posts. The underground market occupies a network of converted storage tunnels beneath the old Rooks barracks complex. Tourists never see it. Returning visitors are given directions on their second visit if their first visit demonstrated discretion.
