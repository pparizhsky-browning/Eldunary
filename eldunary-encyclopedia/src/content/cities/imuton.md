summary: "Ancient forest city where residents live inside tree-trunk hollows. No new construction allowed — the city grows only as the forest grows."
---

**Imuton** was not built in a forest. Imuton is the forest — its residents live, work, sleep, and govern from within the hollowed trunks of the ancient trees that predate the republic by centuries. Every tree that houses people in Imuton was selected over generations for careful hollow expansion: the cut is made with the grain, sealed with growing compounds, and the tree allowed to continue growing around its inhabited hollow.

The result is a city of living walls that change with the seasons: golden in autumn, bare in winter, explosive with green in spring, dense and shadowed in summer. No two houses are identical because no two trees are identical. Identifying addresses requires knowing the tree — by local name, bark pattern, or personal introduction.

**No new construction** is permitted within Imuton's forest bounds. The city can only expand if a new tree is judged ready to accept habitation, which is a council decision that typically involves a ceremony, a negotiation with the tree's existing inhabitant species (birds, insects, the occasional spirit), and a waiting period of not less than seven years from the initial judgment.

Citizens of Imuton tend toward quiet professions: crafts, scholarship, preservation work, and forest-knowledge trades. **Ace** recruits here specifically for agents with patience and observational habits that are difficult to develop elsewhere — people who have learned to hear what the forest notices before they notice it themselves.
