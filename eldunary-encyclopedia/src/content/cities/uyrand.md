If Iyhago Prime is the soul of the Quiet Harmonic, **Uyrand** is where its administrative body operates. The capital manages the bureaucracy of a kingdom built on magical philosophy: licensing practitioners, archiving spell lineages, negotiating with the Magic Societies, and operating the diplomatic infrastructure that makes Iyhago the neutral ground for conversations between organizations that cannot otherwise be in the same room.

The skyline is defined by **archive towers** — needle-thin stone spires packed with preserved records, each floor dedicated to a specific era or magical discipline. The oldest towers date back to before the First Great War. Scholars who need access to specific records must apply to the Archive Office, which will locate the tower, floor, and shelf reference for a modest administrative fee and a two-week processing time (one week for magical emergency status requests).

**Rose** established its permanent headquarters in Uyrand because no other city on Criozevan is as geopolitically neutral while still being meaningfully connected to every major faction. Rose's Uyrand tower houses its leadership council, intelligence coordination center, and the rumored Vault of Oaths — a chamber where Rose keeps its most sensitive alliance documentation sealed under witness magic.

The city's vertical architecture reflects Iyhago's philosophy: layers of knowledge, each accessible, each in its proper order, ascending toward understanding.
