*The ground in Clocester sounds hollow when you walk on it. That's because it is.*

**Clocester** is where people go when they need to be at the intersection of multiple places without being officially anywhere. As a former mining colony, it sits above tunnel access points connecting to the Kingdom of Fodon, Republic of Frada, and Kingdom of Iyhago borders — making it a natural convergence point for cross-kingdom traffic that prefers not to use official border crossings.

The crystal caverns beneath the city are extraordinary — ancient geological formations from when the mining operations first broke through into deep crystal pockets. They are also dangerous: the hollow ground means underground duels (an informal tradition in Clocester's criminal community) occasionally cause structural collapses in buildings above.

The **neutral forge** here operates under **Rose** protection — a rare sanctioned neutral space where people from opposing factions can commission metalwork without triggering conflict. Rose doesn't protect the forge out of charitable motivation; the forge is valuable intelligence infrastructure, and everyone entering it is observed.

Population: mixed refugees and runaways, people who needed to stop being somewhere identifiable. The local economy runs on the gap between what official channels charge for services and what the underground economy charges for the same services faster and without paperwork.
