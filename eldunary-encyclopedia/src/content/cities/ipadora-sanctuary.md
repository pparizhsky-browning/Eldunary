Capital of the Ipadora Kingdom. Located on the western side of the Ipadora island. A true sanctuary — almost no crime. Welcomes outsiders, refugees, and peaceful travelers. Has both a surface island city and a vast underwater complex. The Ipadora Palace lies beneath the island in a heavily secured cavern.
