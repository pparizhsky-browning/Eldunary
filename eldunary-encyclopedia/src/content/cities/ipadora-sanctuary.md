There is no city in Criozevan with a lower recorded crime rate than **Ipadora Sanctuary**. This is not because the city polices aggressively — it is because the culture that Queen Nayele has cultivated over her reign produces a population that resolves disputes through the city's extraordinarily efficient arbitration network before they become offenses.

The city is built in the deep ocean — its coral-and-crystal architecture is entirely bioluminescent, lit from within by the creatures, plants, and engineered organisms that the Ipadora have cultivated across generations. At night (by depth clock — there is no surface light here), the city pulses with a slow, gentle rhythm of blue-green light that residents describe as calming and first-time visitors describe as the most beautiful thing they have ever seen.

**Queen Nayele** has made welcome hospitality a governing philosophy: every race, nation, and organization may enter Ipadora Sanctuary and be treated as a guest of the kingdom, provided they abide by its one firm law — *no violence within city bounds*. Violations of this law are handled by the Queen's Guard with a speed and completeness that visitors quickly understand is not inconsistent with the city's peaceful character.

The **Ipadora Royal Family** has governed here for generations. The palace, at the city's deepest point, is open to visitors on the first day of each season — the Royal Audience, when any person may present a concern, request, or gift to the Queen or her designated representative. The waiting list for a Royal Audience appointment is typically seven months long.
