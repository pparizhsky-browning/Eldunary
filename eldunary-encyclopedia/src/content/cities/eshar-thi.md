summary: "A small independent union nation that occupied the territory now held by Uyrand and Andport in the Kingdom of Iyhago. Conquered by the Azure Paladin's Republic of Frada in 730 ACC. Dissolved following his corruption and departure from Frada. Its territory was eventually absorbed into Iyhago. The name derives from eshar (erasure) and thi (form) — a people whose architecture and philosophy centered on the extensive use of mirrored surfaces to dissolve the boundaries of visible form."

**Eshar-Thi** no longer exists. Its territory — the two-settlement union that once occupied the plains between Frada and the southern island of Vehalo — is now fully within the Kingdom of Iyhago, home to the cities of **Uyrand** and **Andport**.

## The Name

*Eshar* — erasure. *Thi* — form. Together: **the erasure of form**.

This was not an accidental name or a metaphor. It described the union's foundational philosophy directly: that the boundaries of physical form — walls, edges, faces, distinctions between self and world — were illusions to be dissolved through reflection. The Eshar-Thi built with mirrors the way other cultures built with stone.

Their cities used mirrored surfaces extensively — not as decoration but as structural philosophy. Walls were faced with polished obsidian and hammered metal sheets. Public spaces were designed so that a person standing at the center could see themselves and their surroundings reflected from multiple angles simultaneously, making it impossible to locate exactly where one surface ended and another began. Buildings were constructed to fracture their own outlines. The intent was to make the built environment feel like a space where form was always in the process of being undone.

The effect on outsiders was typically disorientation. The effect on residents — who grew up navigating spaces designed to dissolve fixed perception — was a cultural orientation toward ambiguity, indirect communication, and the belief that hard certainty about anything was a sign of incomplete understanding.

## What It Was

Eshar-Thi was a small union nation: two independent settlements — Uyrand and Andport — that had come to operate under a shared governing framework. The arrangement was informal by the standards of larger kingdoms, built on mutual interest rather than any formal charter. The two settlements traded with each other, maintained a shared riverway garrison, and recognized a common leadership council for external matters.

It was never a great power. It was geographically significant — positioned along key transit routes between Frada's northern plains and the southern coast — which is what made it a target.

## The Conquest (730 ACC)

In **730 ACC**, the **Azure Paladin** — founder and leader of the nascent Republic of Frada — marched his military forces into Eshar-Thi's territory. The campaign was not prolonged. The union nation lacked the standing army needed to repel a disciplined military force built for exactly this kind of action.

The conquest was framed by Frada as an annexation — the absorption of a lesser-organized territory into a more structured governing system. Eshar-Thi's council was dissolved. The Azure Paladin installed Fradan administrative authority over both settlements and folded the territory's garrison and resources into the republic's military apparatus.

It was one of several territorial expansions the Azure Paladin pursued during this period. It was not the last, but it was among the most geographically significant — the territory gave Frada a direct foothold on routes toward the southern island, extending the republic's reach considerably.

## Dissolution

The Eshar-Thi conquest was conducted under the Azure Paladin's direct authority. When he turned to dark magic in **732 ACC** and began his departure from Frada's governance, his administrative structures in the absorbed territories lost their original momentum.

The Republic of Frada retained the territory in name for some period afterward, but without the Azure Paladin's driving ambition, the republic's attention contracted back toward its own borders. The Eshar-Thi settlements — geographically distant and culturally distinct from Frada's core — were not held with the same investment they had been under conquest.

As the **Kingdom of Iyhago** expanded its territory under Veles in the decades following the Great War (795 ACC), the settlements previously known as Eshar-Thi were absorbed into Iyhago's governance through negotiation. They have since been known simply as **Uyrand** and **Andport** — named for what they always were, without reference to the union that once connected them.

## What Remained

Nothing of the Eshar-Thi governing structure survived. The council was dissolved and not reconstituted. The name passed out of common use within a few generations. In contemporary Criozevan, "Eshar-Thi" appears only in pre-800 ACC historical records and in scholars' accounts of Frada's early expansion. Most citizens of Uyrand and Andport have no awareness that their cities were once a separate polity.
