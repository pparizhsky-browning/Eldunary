summary: "Second largest city in Criozevan. Four war-torn districts unified by Lucifer killing all district leaders. Desert. Tense but functional."

*Fodon smells like sand and old fire. The ruins of the district wars are preserved not as memorial but as neighborhood — people build their homes on the foundations of battles their grandparents fought.*

**Fodon** is the second largest city in Criozevan and the most complex: built in arid desert on the northwest peninsula, divided for decades between four violent districts (*Bug*, *Magic*, *Death*, and *Fire*) that only stopped fighting when **Lucifer (#6 Arashi)** killed all four district leaders in sequence.

The city has not forgotten this. The districts are no longer at war but they have not merged — they remain culturally distinct neighborhoods with fierce pride in their history and occasional friction at their borders. The Dune Accord, governing through four elected representatives plus the Voice of Sand, emerged from this fragile peace.

**Ashglass Hall** — built where Vulkran died, walls of black obsidian and lava glass, council debates beneath molten-stone pillars — is both the government chamber and the city's most striking architectural achievement.

The city was originally divided into four districts led by warlords:
- **Vorvax** led the Bug District — her death with Lucifer also ended the Tharnex race.
- **Azaraith, the Nightweaver** led the Magic District — her face was never revealed.
- **Varnokh** commanded the Death District — his body was never recovered.
- **Vulkran** ruled the Fire District — his remains still warm in the canyon near Plodrough.

Today Fodon is a diverse metropolis. The ruins of district conflicts give it the layered archaeology of a city that survived itself.
