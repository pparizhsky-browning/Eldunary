summary: "Capital of the Kingdom of Fodon. Second largest city in Criozevan. Four war-torn districts unified by Lucifer killing all district leaders. Arid desert next to the sea. Extremely diverse."
---

Second largest city on the continent. Capital of the Kingdom of Fodon. Located on the northwest peninsula of Criozevan. Arid desert climate next to the sea. Extremely diverse.

Historically divided into four warring districts, each ruled by a powerful leader:

- **Bug District** – Ruled by **[Vorvax](/characters/vorvax)**, rumored to be the last matriarch of the Tharnex. Clad in shifting armor that sensed danger before any blade could strike, she ruled from the shadows. Her eyes missed nothing. Once she was killed, the rest of the Tharnex race perished.
- **Magic District** – Ruled by **[Azaraith](/characters/azaraith)**, called the Nightweaver. Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces with her staff. No one knows what lies behind her mask. Even the Arashi once hesitated to challenge her rule.
- **Death District** – Ruled by **[Varnokh](/characters/varnokh)**, a towering armored construct powered by a magenta arcane core. He enforced order through death rituals and executions, wielding a massive scythe-axe linked to necromantic energy. His body was never recovered.
- **Fire District** – Ruled by **[Vulkran](/characters/vulkran)**, a knight of molten steel and volcanic power who wielded a lava-blade and obsidian shield. His armor radiated enough heat to melt sand into glass. Born in Zhuiburn. His remains lie entombed in a fire-cracked canyon near Plodrough — still warm to this day.

The districts were in constant war until **[Lucifer](/characters/lucifer)** (#6 Arashi) killed all four district leaders, ending the era of the Warring Districts.
