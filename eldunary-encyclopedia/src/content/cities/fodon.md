summary: "Second largest city in Criozevan. Four war-torn districts unified by Lucifer killing all district leaders. Desert. Tense but functional."

Second largest city on the continent. Located on the northwest peninsula. Divided into four historic districts: Bug, Magic, Death, and Fire. Arid desert climate next to the sea. Extremely diverse. The districts fought for decades until Lucifer (#6 Arashi) killed all four district leaders.
