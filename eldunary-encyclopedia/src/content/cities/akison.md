*Akison is not a city built on an island. Akison is the island — every inch of it shaped, designed, and maintained according to the principles of the Iron Path.*

**Akison** expands outward from the **Iron Bloom** palace at its center in the pattern of five cherry blossom petals: the **Five Blossom Rings (Sakura-go)**. Ancient Japanese-inspired architecture — curved rooftops that sweep upward at the corners, zen courtyards filled with raked stone patterns that represent different Iron Path principles, fortified bamboo walls reinforced with stone at load-bearing points, and walkways suspended over water between districts. The city is both extraordinarily beautiful and militarily practical, which is essentially the Iron Path philosophy made physical.

**Sunlee**, Master of Martial Arts, governs from the Iron Bloom in Tetsukaku. The city is a trade and travel hub connected to other continents — the only location in Criozevan with regular international shipping routes. Merchants from beyond Criozevan know Akison before they know any other city on the continent.

**Biruda (#7 Arashi)** was born in Akison, learned the way of the Oni Samurai here, and left to become something the city produced but would not contain.

The **Kurashiki Region** in the northern mountains houses the most powerful samurai and shinobi clans, operating under clan law with negotiated loyalty to Sunlee's Iron Path. Entry to Kurashiki territory requires clan sponsorship.

The city's black market district (Uramizu) operates openly enough to be mapped but covertly enough that nothing can be officially traced to it. Sunlee is aware. He tolerates what he cannot eliminate without destabilizing the economy.
