summary: "Dry plains farming town. River agricultural port. The most peaceful settlement in the Kingdom of Fodon."
---

**Sloumont** is the agricultural anchor of the Kingdom of Fodon — a dry plains farming town on the river that provides the food supply the desert cities cannot grow for themselves. Without Sloumont, Fodon city and the canyon towns would be dependent on expensive imports. This economic function gives the small town more political weight than its size suggests.

The small agricultural port handles river shipping to and from Fodon and the connected territories. The town is notably peaceful by Kingdom of Fodon standards — no active faction conflict, no district war legacy, no criminal infrastructure worth noting. The residents grow things and ship them. They have maintained this practice through the district wars, through Lucifer's campaign, and through every political upheaval the last century has produced.

They intend to continue.
