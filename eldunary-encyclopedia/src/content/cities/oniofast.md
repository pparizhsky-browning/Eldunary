summary: "Pegasus' hidden operational HQ. No magic practitioners, no Rose, no Butterfly allowed. Home of the Signal Harvest collection ritual."
---

Jungle town on the mainland of the State of Akison, built into ancient overgrown ruins. Pegasus covert operations HQ. Streets are half-mechanical, half-organic. Rose, Butterfly, and magis are banned by silent agreement — entry is suicide. Known for its annual 'Signal Harvest,' when rogue tech is extracted from the jungle. Locals trained in survival, stealth, and encryption.
