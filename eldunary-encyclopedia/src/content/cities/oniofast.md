summary: "Pegasus' hidden operational HQ. No magic practitioners, no Rose, no Butterfly allowed. Home of the Signal Harvest collection ritual."

High in the northern peaks of Akison, buried under alpine fog, **Oniofast** is the mountain fortress that Pegasus quietly made its own. No signage announces its importance. No royal decree marks it as special. Yet every Pegasus operative knows: if you need a decision made at the highest level, Oniofast is where decisions happen.

**Magic is banned** within Oniofast's walls — not by law, but by a long-standing covenant with the mountain clans who first allowed Pegasus to use the site. Magic practitioners, Rose members, and Butterfly agents are unwelcome here; those who enter against convention disappear quietly. Berserk (#2 Arashi) has made Oniofast his preferred residence when not on assignment — the cold suits him, and the isolation keeps him sharp.

The **Signal Harvest** occurs every Autumn Convergence: Pegasus operatives from across Criozevan converge on Oniofast to deliver field reports in person, since Pegasus trusts no message system for its most sensitive intelligence. The event lasts seven days. The city doubles its population. Then everyone disperses and Oniofast returns to its silent vigil.

The town's economy runs on alpine herding, preserved foods, and weapons repair. The true economy runs on information.
