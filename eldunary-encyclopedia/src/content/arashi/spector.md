  description: "A Realm Expansion ability that replaces the surrounding environment with an infinite mirrored space. Inside the Hall of Mirrors, every surface reflects — not light, but the observer's own movement, intent, and position. Navigation becomes impossible without perfect knowledge of oneself. The user moves freely; anyone else walks in circles."

**Spector** is the anomaly in the Arashi's general preference for operational obscurity: he lives in **Andport** under his Arashi designation, does not particularly conceal his affiliation, and appears to have decided that the most effective security posture for someone with the Phantom Domain is a kind of radical transparency that makes surveillance meaningless — if you can create up to twelve perfect physical duplicates of yourself, all independently mobile, all capable of using your abilities at reduced fidelity, then being *known* to be in Andport does not actually tell anyone where Spector is at any moment.

The **Phantom Domain** is the most investigation-hostile ability in the Arashi's known roster for exactly this reason. Following Spector produces information about a duplicate. Confronting Spector produces engagement with a duplicate. Finding the original requires either eliminating all duplicates simultaneously (which none have managed) or possessing an ability that distinguishes the original from its copies (which, in documented engagements, nothing has reliably done — not magical perception, not physical inspection, not psychological assessment).

He uses Andport's Oath-Walking culture with visible appreciation — he participates in the tradition, walks the bridge when agreements are made, and is generally a presence in the city's civic life that the city finds unsettling in the abstract and manageable in the specific. The local population has accommodated the presence of a known Arashi member because the presence has never manifested in any harm to Andport, and the presence does occasionally resolve disputes with the efficiency of someone who has the ability to be in multiple places and the authority of eleven ranked ones.

**Selvarin's** assessment of Spector, when asked, was: *an interesting problem, if it were one I was asked to solve.*
