Arashi #3.

## Backstory

Born into **the Mist family** — a Folkwynd noble line that served as Wrofast's de facto ruling family — Nebbio was rejected in childhood for being too weak, considered unfit to represent the family name in the maritime and political culture the Mist family embodied. He left Wrofast under humiliation and spent years cultivating power in obscurity.

When he returned in **993 ACC**, he had become something the Mist family had no framework to understand. He killed his father first — the family's head — and continued through the household until no member of the Mist family survived. Wrofast has had no formal noble leadership since.

Nebbio did not stay to govern what he had cleared. He had no interest in Wrofast. He wanted the family to know, at the end, that the child they rejected had come back.
