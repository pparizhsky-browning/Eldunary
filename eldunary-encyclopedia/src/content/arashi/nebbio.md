  description: "A Domain ability that generates a region of dense, self-sustaining mist within which the user is effectively invisible and intangible. The Mist Nebula can carry the user's consciousness as diffuse particles — reducing the user's entire physical presence to mist while retaining sensory awareness."

**Nebbio** occupies a unique position in Criozevan's intelligence landscape: they are the only Arashi member about whom surveillance organizations have almost no useful physical data. Photographs don't capture a consistent face. Physical tracking attempts fail because mist does not leave footprints. Informant networks in Suudon describe someone who is present and then is not present, without transition interval. The **Mist Domain** converts Nebbio's physical form into actual atmospheric vapor at will, instantly, reversibly, and with full sensory maintained throughout — they perceive the world from mist as well as from a body.

The Suudon swamp is the optimal environment for this ability: chronic low-visibility conditions, mist-heavy air, and a geography that confuses outsiders. Nebbio moves through it as naturally as other organisms move through clear air. The Golem King's territory borders the swamp, and the working relationship between Nebbio and the Nikolem Kingdom's forces is one of the more operationally significant non-aggression arrangements in the region — neither party explains it publicly.

Their motivations within the Arashi are the least visible of any confirmed member. Most Arashi members have documented actions that suggest goals — territory, power, ideology, destruction. Nebbio's documented actions are characterized primarily by absence: things that did not happen that would have happened if they had not been there, situations that dissolved without visible intervention, conflicts that ended before they reached the threshold where the Arashi's interest would have been obvious.

**Zunarorth** and Nebbio share Suudon as operational territory and have apparently established a working boundary that neither has publicly explained. That two individuals of their respective capabilities have maintained a territorial arrangement without conflict for years is noted in every strategic analysis of the region as a fact requiring explanation that neither party has provided.
