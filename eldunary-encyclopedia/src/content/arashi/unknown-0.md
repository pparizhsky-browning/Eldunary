summary: "Arashi Rank #0. Identity unknown. No confirmed sighting. Theorized to be an entity operating at Meta-level power, above even Arashi #1 Dark Paladin."

**Rank #0** of the Arashi is listed without a name in every record that tracks the organization's membership, because the name — or the nature — of whoever occupies this position has never been confirmed. The rank exists in the Arashi's own internal documentation, which Pegasus and Rose both obtained partial copies of during separate intelligence operations, and in both copies the top rank is designated with a blank and the notation that the position is "observational, non-operational."

What *observational, non-operational* means for the most powerful ranked entity in an organization already defined by exceptional power is the question that keeps the intelligence analysts employed. The leading theory is that Rank #0 is not a member in the standard sense but an entity whose relationship to the Arashi is something the organization acknowledges rather than directs — a power they are aware of, possibly in contact with, certainly not in control of.

The only indirect evidence comes from Dark Paladin's behavior: Rank #1, the most powerful operational Arashi member, has been observed on several occasions altering course from intended actions in ways that no known tactical or threat assessment explains. Whether this is Rank #0's influence, something else entirely, or a pattern-matching artifact in incomplete surveillance data is unresolved.

**Fluffy** is the closest power-comparable entity that investigators can point to when trying to explain what Rank #0 might be. Whether the two are connected, identical, or separate realities operating at the same scale is the kind of question that gets asked at the highest levels and answered with extended silence.
