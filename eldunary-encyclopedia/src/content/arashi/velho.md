**Velho** appears old in a way that is categorically different from age — not the aged-ness of a body that has lived a long time, but the aged-ness of a thing that was present when everything around it was being formed and has simply not stopped. The name itself means *old one* in a dialect of Common that has not been currentspoken for several centuries, which is the primary evidence for the theory that Velho has been in operation longer than any other Arashi member.

The **Old World Expansion** is the most environmentally destructive Domain-class ability in the documented Arashi roster: it transforms the surrounding region into a state of advanced temporal decay, which in practice means buildings crumble, materials return to their degraded end-state, and anything that does not belong to the "old world" configuration of the area becomes structurally and physically unstable. Fighting Velho in his Expansion is fighting in a collapsing ruin where the ground, walls, and air are all actively trending toward dissolution.

Documented sightings are old — the most recent confirmed one is from before the Crimson Convergence, and even that record is disputed. The Arashi's internal structure accounts for him as active; external intelligence organizations account for him as somewhere between active and mythological, which is an uncomfortable category to maintain in planning documents but accurately reflects the data.

The theory that he was present at the **First Great War** rests on two pieces: architectural degradation patterns at one First Great War site that match Old World Expansion characteristics, and a handwritten account in Pegasus historical archives that describes a figure matching Velho's described appearance observed at the conflict's resolution point. The account does not describe what he did there. It notes that he came, stood at the edge, watched, and left before anyone spoke to him.
