**Dark Paladin** chose Icogas when every other location on the continent would have been easier. This is the most important thing currently known about him — not his power level (which is established by rank and confirmed by the researchers who have approached the topic from every conceivable safe distance), but the fact that the most powerful operational villain in Criozevan deliberately lives in a city with uncontrolled magical instability that affects everyone near it.

The implication that most analysts have settled on: the instability doesn't affect him. Or affects him in ways he finds useful. Either conclusion is alarming.

His **Death Eye** ability is classified as a perception-class Meta-adjacent trait: a mode of observation that strips away the representation of a thing and reveals its structural fatal points — where a wall would crack, where a defense would fail, where a person's body would stop functioning, where a system's logic breaks down. There is no known defense against an opponent who has already identified, before engagement begins, the precise conditions under which you stop existing.

Very little confirmed biographical information exists. The moniker *Dark Paladin* was assigned by external observers based on the armored appearance of the figure in the two documented visual records. Whether he chose it, acknowledges it, or is aware of it as his primary designation in outside records is unknown. He has not been confronted directly by any organization's operative who then filed a useful report.
