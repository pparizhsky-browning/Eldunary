**Berserk** (Arashi Rank #2) was known, before he was Arashi, as a fighter in Akison with unusual combat characteristics — specifically, the characteristic that fighting him harder produced worse outcomes for the person doing so. His **Berserker Domain** is the source: a Domain ability that routes incoming damage into real-time power amplification, meaning that every hit landed on Berserk is, in effect, an investment in the person landing it eventually losing.

He trained briefly under **Sunlee** in Akison's Koganemura district before the Iron Path's structure became incompatible with what his Domain was turning him into. Sunlee's assessment, known indirectly through Akison records, was that Berserk had the capacity for exceptional discipline but that his ability's nature made discipline harder to maintain the more fully he engaged it. The Berserker Domain does not care about measured response; it optimizes for continuation of combat and escalation of parameters.

He chose **Oniofast** because the cold and isolation suit a person who cannot casually socialize without the constant management of what happens when his Domain begins activating in non-combat contexts due to environmental stressors. The mountain fortress's distance from population centers is not coincidental. His presence at Signal Harvest periods — when the mountain briefly fills with people — is managed through protocols that the Pegasus operatives who attend have learned to follow carefully.

The **Crimson Knight** is the only Power Rank figure on record who has engaged Berserk directly and then communicated clearly about what the engagement involved. He described it as the closest he has come to a situation where his standard tactical frameworks were actively contraindicated. This statement circulates in every strategic planning document that involves Arashi threat assessment.
