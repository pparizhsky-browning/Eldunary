**Ryobik** is described in Arashi operational documents recovered by Rose intelligence services as the organization's *containment specialist* — the member called when something needs to be held in place, held back, or held together temporarily long enough for other objectives to be accomplished. The **Chain Domain** generating gravitational force chains capable of binding entities many times the user's physical scale is the ability that earns that designation.

The chains are not material in the standard sense — they are solidified gravitational force, which means that materials capable of cutting, melting, or otherwise defeating conventional binding do not function on them. What can defeat them is unknown from external observation; what the documents note is that the chains have held against every test the Arashi has subjected them to, including tests against the abilities of other Arashi members, which is the most credible performance description available.

The ability to **anchor a chain to a fixed point in space** regardless of the material composition of that space is the detail that security-focused practitioners at every organization find most concerning about operational planning for confrontations involving Ryobik. A chain that can be fixed to empty air is not addressable by removing the physical mount point, which removes the standard counter to chain-based binding abilities.

Location is unknown in the same category as Velho and Oto — actively untracked rather than tracked and not found. Ryobik appears in operational contexts and then does not appear in any surveillance record afterward. The Chain Domain has obvious utility for someone who wants to leave a space where they were detected: anchor a chain, pull, and the exit is instant.
