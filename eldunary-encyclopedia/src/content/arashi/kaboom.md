  type: "Death Eye"
  description: "A Death Eye ability that identifies the maximum detonation yield achievable from the user's current energy output — and then delivers exactly that yield. The Nuke does not produce a fixed explosion; it produces the specific explosion calibrated to reduce a given target structure to its minimum possible state."

summary: "Arashi Rank #9. Goldhelm. Left the Goldhelm Kingdom's scientific research program to join the Arashi. Detonation Domain charges any touched material with explosive potential. Partner of Helm (#12)."

**Kaboom** was, before the Arashi, a Goldhelm scientific researcher in **Ibeson**'s underground laboratory complex — specifically in the materials engineering division working on holotech explosive applications for the Auric Vanguard. He left the Goldhelm Kingdom under circumstances that King Aldric's administration classified and has not publicly explained, which among intelligence organizations is understood as confirmation that the departure was not voluntary and that the departure's cause was something the Kingdom does not want discussed.

The **Detonation Domain** is the ability that made him exceptional in the research program and impossible to contain outside it: the capacity to charge any material he physically contacts with explosive potential, calibrated to whatever yield and timing he specifies. As a researcher, this was an extraordinary engineering tool. As a person with grievances against the institution that trained him, it is a continuous security problem for that institution.

His relationship with **Helm** (Rank #12, also from Ibeson) is the most documented Arashi internal partnership. They appear to operate as complementary capabilities — Kaboom provides the demolition capability, Helm provides the strategic analysis of where demolition achieves desired outcomes. The combination is efficient in a way that single actors with similar total power ratings are not.

He does not appear to have left science at the Arashi. His approach to the Detonation Domain is methodical and engineering-minded — precise yield, precise direction, no wasted energy. The Goldhelm training that the Kingdom wished it had not provided persists in the discipline with which he applies what they taught him against what they intended.
