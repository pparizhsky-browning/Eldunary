  description: "A Death Eye ability that perceives the precise frequency threshold at which any target's auditory system will overload — and then produces exactly that frequency. The Audio Overload is calibrated to each target individually; what incapacitates one being is inaudible to another."

summary: "Arashi Rank #8. Unknown location. Resonance Domain perceives and controls sound frequencies. Can shatter any material by finding its resonant frequency. Most communications-capable Arashi member."

**Oto** is the Arashi member whose location is most genuinely unknown — not because he is hiding, but because the **Resonance Domain** means his operational presence need not correspond to his physical location. He can communicate across vast distances by frequency transmission, can perceive events through the sound they produce at ranges that effectively eliminate the information advantage of geographic distance, and operates in whatever location happens to be optimal for what he is doing without needing to be anywhere in particular for anyone to know he was there.

The ability to shatter materials at their resonant frequency is the most discussed of his capabilities among engineers and architects — it means that any constructed defense, regardless of material composition, has a specific frequency at which it becomes catastrophically unstable, and Oto can find that frequency through the Resonance Domain without prior knowledge. This characteristic has influenced building design in certain security-focused locations across Criozevan, none of which will confirm that the design changes were Oto-responsive.

His rank at #8 is consistent with the Arashi's overall structure: high enough that he is an active operational asset, not so high that the organization directs him toward the organization's most significant objectives. What he uses the Resonance Domain for in service of Arashi goals is documented only in the outcomes — the specific missions attributed to him are inferred from the method of effect rather than observed directly.

He is described in the two witness accounts that exist as quiet — someone who speaks rarely and, when he does, with frequency precision that makes people feel the words more than hear them.
