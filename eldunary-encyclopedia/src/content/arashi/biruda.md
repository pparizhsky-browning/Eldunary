**Biruda** holds the distinction of being the Arashi member whose origin is most clearly documented, because Akison keeps good records and his early training under Sunlee in the Koganemura district predates any attempt to obscure his history. The records show a student with exceptional capacity, unusual progress speed through the Iron Path's ranked discipline, and a growing incompatibility between the Iron Path's collective philosophy and whatever Biruda was becoming.

He left before any action was taken. Sunlee, in the records, notes the departure without judgment — the Iron Path measures people by what they make of themselves, and what Biruda made of himself after Akison is something that the records view with neither endorsement nor condemnation from their originating institution.

The **Oni Form Domain** activates a transformation into the mythological Oni warrior tradition that Akison's martial culture references as its deepest archetype — amplified scale, amplified physical parameters, and the generation of dark spiritual energy that disrupts malefici and runestone abilities operating in proximity. Opposing practitioners find their abilities less stable, less controllable, and in some documented cases temporarily offline in the Oni Form's presence. For a combat specialist from a martially-focused culture, the ability to suppress the magical advantages of opponents is the most tactically significant element.

In Akison, where he occasionally returns, he is neither welcomed nor confronted. People who knew him are aware of what he became. The cultural tradition that created him does not disown its products; it assesses them honestly. The assessment, from those who trained with him, is: exceptional ability, path of his own choosing, outcome consistent with the trajectory they observed developing before he left.
