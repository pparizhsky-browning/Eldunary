Arashi #7. Born on Akison and learned the way of the Oni Samurai. An outcast as a child, he left to learn forging and engineering. Upgraded himself by attaching parts of his metallic creations directly to his body.

**Appearance:** Biruda's face is a terrifying fusion of metal and flesh. His mechanical eyes glow with an eerie red light, giving him an unsettling, inhuman gaze. His cybernetic limbs emit faint whirring sounds when he moves. The overall effect is one of cold, calculated menace — a being that has deliberately replaced his own humanity with engineered precision.
