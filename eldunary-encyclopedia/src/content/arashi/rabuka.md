**Rabuka** grew up in Glaril — not in its criminal waterfront but in its ordinary residential depth, a Sharkai child in an Ipadora-majority city with the full weight of both identities developed in parallel. The Sharkai blood frenzy that his race experiences in combat is a physiological fact that he has never fully controlled; what he has done is develop the surrounding skills to ensure that his tactical position at the point when it activates is already decided in his favor.

The **Blood Current Domain** is the ability that distinguishes him operationally: a dual-function Domain that detects all blood-containing organisms within a significant radius (the documented range is approximately a kilometer in open water, less on land) and that allows him to manipulate water and liquid currents with the precision of an extension of his own body. In open ocean, this makes conventional engagement nearly impossible for any opponent who is not either immune to liquid-based attacks or fast enough to exit the water before the Domain fully activates.

His relationship with the **Ipadora Kingdom** is complicated. He is from there. Queen Nayele knows him. He chose a path the kingdom does not endorse, and she has not moved to stop him, which the Arashi and every intelligence organization interprets differently and all incorrectly, having incomplete information about what was said directly between them.

He does not announce his Arashi affiliation in Glaril. In the city where he grew up, he is understood by those who knew him as the person who was always going to leave for something larger and found something that fit. Whether that something is what he intended to find, and whether he has a destination beyond this rank, is the question he has not answered.
