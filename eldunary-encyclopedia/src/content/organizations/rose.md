---

**Rose** occupies the political position that no other organization on Criozevan maintains: genuine neutrality, maintained by active choice and constant strategic effort, across every faction conflict in the continent's history. Rose does not control territory. It does not install leaders. It does not run shadow governments. What it does is operate the diplomatic and intelligence infrastructure that allows factions to communicate, negotiate, and occasionally understand each other when their direct engagement would produce only armed conflict.

The organization's headquarters in **Uyrand** (Iyhago Kingdom) is deliberately located in the continent's most neutral political territory — a theocratic state governed by philosophical principles rather than resource competition, with no territorial expansion ambitions and a cultural disposition toward hosting rather than dominating. Rose's tower in Uyrand houses the organization's leadership council and the rumored **Vault of Oaths**, where its most sensitive alliance documentation is stored under witness magic.

Rose's **diplomatic standing** with every major faction, including the underwater Ipadora Kingdom, is the operational asset that makes it irreplaceable. When Pegasus and Butterfly cannot be in the same room, they can both send representatives to Rose. When Crimson Rooks and a regional power have reached an impasse, Rose provides the channel that allowed the last seven such impasses to resolve without armed engagement. The organization charges for this role, not in currency but in information: every Rose mediation produces intelligence insights funneled into Rose's analytical network.

The organization was founded in the aftermath of the **Crimson Convergence**, when enough factions recognized that the absence of a neutral intermediary had directly contributed to the conflict's scale. Rose is, in the most literal sense, an institution built from the lesson of a catastrophe — and maintained by the shared understanding that repeating it would be worse.
