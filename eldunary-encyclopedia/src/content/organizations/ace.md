The Ace organization's founding date is not publicly established. Its first confirmed historical appearance is during the **War of Fodon (820–847 ACC)**, when the organization was hired by **Vorvax**, leader of the Bug District, to protect the Tharnex population from the attacks of other districts. During this period, the Aces carried out both defensive operations and targeted assassinations of individuals threatening the Bug District's survival. Whether the organization existed before this engagement or was formed specifically for it is unknown.

## Structure

The Ace organization consists of exactly **52 members**, divided into four equal **Suits** (divisions) of 13 members each. The Suits are **Spades**, **Diamonds**, **Hearts**, and **Clubs**. Within each Suit, members hold one of 13 **Ranks**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace — with Ace being the most powerful rank in each Suit and 2 being the lowest. Every rank within every Suit is held by exactly one member.

## Chain of Command

The organization is led by the **Ace of Spades**, who holds supreme authority and assigns each Suit its contracted work. The Spades are considered the most elite Suit — the other three Suits are considered equal in standing beneath them, each specializing in different operational domains. Members of higher rank within a Suit carry greater operational authority and are assigned higher-complexity contracts.

## Identifying Markers

Every Ace member wears a mask and a suit. The mask displays the member's Suit symbol and Rank in the playing card notation of their specific designation. A member is never publicly identified by name, only by their card. The mask is never removed in the presence of clients or targets.

## Capabilities

Ace members are considered the finest bounty hunters, trackers, assassins, and protection operatives in the world. The organization accepts contracts for security, assassination, and kidnapping, with no stated ideological position beyond the completion of the paid contract. They are known for operational precision and an exceptional success rate.

## Known Operations

- Protection of the Bug District during the War of Fodon (c. 820–847 ACC)
- Ongoing law enforcement contract in Adlens, hired by the local government
- Assassination of political rivals during the Goldhelm succession crisis following Aldric's death, hired by the new Goldhelm General

The full scope of their historical contract work is not publicly documented.

## Public Status

Extremely mysterious. Less publicly documented than even the Arashi. The organization does not announce itself, recruit openly, or negotiate with governments. It is found by those who know how to look.
