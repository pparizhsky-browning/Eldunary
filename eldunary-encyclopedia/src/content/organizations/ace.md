summary: "Small elite covert organization. Enforces the peace in Adlens — the neutral coalition town. No stated ideology. Acts as a wild card in Criozevan's political conflicts. Led by a single figure also called Ace."

**Ace** is small enough to be dismissed and dangerous enough that dismissal is a consistent error. The organization has no published ideology, no stated mission, and no territorial objective. What it has is reach — connections in every city, capabilities that don't cluster neatly into any power system's classification, and a track record of showing up in Criozevan's crises at the points where a single decisive action would determine the outcome, and taking that action.

The **Adlens peace** is Ace's most publicly visible achievement and ongoing responsibility: the neutral coalition town where representatives of hostile factions coexist requires active enforcement, and the enforcement mechanism is Ace's presence. No faction serious about its own strategic interests wants to be the one responsible for breaking the Adlens arrangement — the diplomatic cost is real — but absent enforcement, calculation about breaking it would begin. Ace's presence is the deterrent that makes those calculations consistently unfavorable.

The organization's leader is known by the same name as the organization — a figure called **Ace** who has been described in records spanning several decades without consistent aging indicators, leading to the theories that either the name passes between successors (possible) or the original holder has unusual longevity (also possible, given the power levels present in Criozevan). The answer has not been confirmed.

Their presence in **Kusamori** and **Okbridge** suggests a broader Akison-region operational interest than the Adlens mandate explains — what they are doing in those locations, and how it connects to their Adlens responsibility, is one of the small-organization mysteries that intelligence analysts flag as requiring more data before pattern assessment is meaningful.
