Each kingdom in Criozevan — with the exception of the **Goldhelm Kingdom**, where magic is prohibited under penalty of death — maintains an official **Magic Society** that functions as part of the kingdom's formal government. These societies are named simply after their host kingdom:

- Vacron Magic Society
- Oredsy Magic Society
- Fodon Magic Society
- Iyhago Magic Society
- Ipadora Magic Society
- Akison Magic Society
- Nikolem Magic Society

Each society operates independently within its own kingdom's legal and political structure, but all hold their continental meetings in **Klanron** (Kingdom of Vacron) — the continent's primary gathering point for magic users and the headquarters of the Butterfly organization. The Butterfly organization works directly with each society to forge cross-kingdom alliances and coordinate responses to magical threats.
