The **Magic Societies** are not a government and do not claim to be one. They lack enforcement authority, cannot compel compliance, and have no mechanism to punish practitioners who violate their guidelines beyond expulsion from the network (which removes access to shared research, training resources, and the practitioner registry that provides legal status in most kingdoms). Despite these limitations, their guidelines are followed by the overwhelming majority of practitioners in Criozevan, because the alternative is isolation from the most valuable knowledge-sharing network that magic users have access to.

Governance operates through a **Council system** with representatives from each major magical tradition: malefici, runestones, holotech, and the remaining traditions. The Council meets twice yearly in Iyhago Prime's lower Sanctum Spiral, with Butterfly representatives attending as observers and Veles available for consultation on philosophical questions that exceed the Council's own framework.

**Research publication** is the Societies' primary visible output: the most significant magical discoveries made by their member scholars are published through the Society network before they are published anywhere else, giving members first access to theoretical and practical advances. This publication pipeline is what makes membership valuable enough to sustain the compliance structure — even practitioners who disagree with specific guidelines maintain membership for access to the research.

**Veles** holds de facto authority that exceeds any formal position he holds because his accumulated knowledge spans every tradition in the Societies and his assessments carry the weight of that span. When the Council reaches an impasse, the question *what does Veles think* is asked before any other resolution mechanism is tried. He does not attend Council meetings regularly, which the Council finds simultaneously frustrating and understands as a statement about what governance actually requires of him.
