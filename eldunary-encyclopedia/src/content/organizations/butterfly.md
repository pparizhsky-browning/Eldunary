**Butterfly** is the organization most magic practitioners encounter first — not as a governing body (it has no legal authority) but as the network that provides training resources, safety frameworks, and peer accountability for magic use across Criozevan. If you practice malefici, runestones, or corrupted runes with any seriousness, Butterfly has probably issued an assessment of your ability level, and that assessment is what most societies use to determine what you're legally permitted to do with your abilities.

The **Klanron** headquarters reflects the organization's character: a city that is 90% magic practitioners, where the concentration of talent produces ambient magical phenomena that the rest of Criozevan would consider extraordinary and that Klanron residents find ordinary. The Magic Societies hold their governance councils in the lower Sanctum Spiral of Iyhago Prime with Butterfly representation at every session.

**Magical oversight** is the organization's primary function: monitoring dangerous sites (the Icogas nexus, the Darkmane Realm's corrupted rune concentration zones, the Runestone deposits in Nikolem), maintaining the practitioner registry that other organizations reference for identity verification, and publishing the magical incident reports that allow governments to understand what is happening in their territories at a level of detail that military surveillance cannot provide.

The alignment with **Iyhago's Quiet Harmonic** is philosophical rather than operational — both believe that magical power requires stewardship and that the consequences of magical imbalance extend beyond the individual practitioner. Butterfly does not govern itself by Iyhago law, but the conceptual overlap produces close working relations. When Butterfly's leadership needs to think through an ethical question that exceeds their framework, **Veles** is the person they call.
