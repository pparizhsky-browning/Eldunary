**The Arashi** is not an organization in the conventional sense — it has no offices, no hierarchy that issues operational directives on a schedule, no treasury, and no external-facing communication. It is a ranked acknowledgment of thirteen individuals whose power and disposition toward destructive action constitute the highest threat tier that Criozevan's assessment frameworks recognize. The rank exists to communicate scale, not to describe a collaborative structure.

The ranking itself, #0 through #12, is maintained in documents that Pegasus and Rose both possess partial copies of, recovered through separate intelligence operations. The documents suggest the ranking is self-assessed within the Arashi via some process that external parties have never observed — the ranks appear accurate by every external power assessment, which means either the Arashi's internal evaluation is rigorous or its members have better information about each other's capabilities than outside observers, or both.

**Operational independence** is the consistent characteristic across all confirmed Arashi members: each pursues objectives that sometimes align with other members' activities and sometimes do not, with no evidence of a central coordination mechanism beyond the communications that individual members choose to conduct. Lucifer's destruction of Fodon's leadership was his own decision. Berserk's residence in Oniofast is his own choice. The lower-ranked members' activities are their own directions. The organization coheres around the ranking, not around any shared program.

The **threat benchmark** function that Criozevan's organizations assign to the Arashi is the most institutionally significant aspect of its existence: every strategic plan involving high-power-level engagement that any organization produces references Arashi rankings as the comparison class. When Something New appears in the power landscape, the first question asked is: *where would it rank among the Arashi?* The organization's existence as a measurement reference outlasts any specific action any member takes.
