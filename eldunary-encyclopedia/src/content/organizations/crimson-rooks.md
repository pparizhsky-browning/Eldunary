The **Crimson Rooks** is the largest openly-acknowledged organization in Criozevan, which is not coincidental — visibility is a deliberate strategic choice. In a world where Pegasus operates invisibly and Butterfly operates quietly, the Rooks operate loudly: their red insignia on enforcement posts in every major city, their uniformed personnel in customs operations across most of the continent, their published organizational structure available to anyone who requests it.

The Crimson Knight controls the organization from its Vacron headquarters, but the control is exercised through a command hierarchy that is both formally documented and personally loyal — the organizational chart is real, and the loyalties that make it function are real, and both are dedicated to a single figure who does not appear above the chart's top line. This structure is known outside the organization. The knowledge does not reduce its effectiveness.

**Enforcement and intelligence** are the organization's dual functions: visible enforcement (customs, law, cross-border inspection) that generates the data flows and presence that intelligence operations depend on, combined with covert intelligence operations that the visible presence provides cover for. The Rooks in Okbridge checking cargo manifests are also logging who is traveling where and for what stated purpose. The aggregate of those logs, across every Rooks presence on the continent, is the most comprehensive movement database in Criozevan.

Founded in the aftermath of the **Crimson Convergence** as the entity that formalized the Crimson Knight's influence into an institutional form, the Rooks serve a stability function that even the organizations most opposed to their reach acknowledge: a Criozevan without the Rooks as an organizational anchor would produce a power vacuum that would be filled by something worse. This recognition is why Rose mediates disputes involving the Rooks rather than opposing them.
