Founded in **Year 738** with a genuinely idealistic purpose: to unite the many small, warring independent territories across the continent and broker lasting peace between them. The organization succeeded for approximately thirty years, creating a period of unusual stability across contested regions.

The collapse was internal. Members in positions of financial oversight began systematically diverting funds — a six-year period of quiet theft that went undetected until the organization was effectively gutted from within. By the time the corruption became public, those responsible had vanished. What remained were the loyalists who had believed in the original mission.

Now operates as a vigilante group that pursues what it considers 'good.' Currently at war with Rose. Maintains a covert operations base in Oniofast (State of Akison). Controls or heavily influences the Republic of Oredsy.
