**Pegasus** does not officially exist. Its membership is not published. Its leadership is not acknowledged. Its headquarters in **Oniofast** is a mountain fortress that appears, on every official map, as an unincorporated alpine settlement. Despite all of this, Pegasus controls two kingdoms, runs the most effective intelligence network on the continent, and is the organization that every other organization's strategic planning must account for.

The organization's founding predates current political memory — its origins trace to the **First Great War**, when several military intelligence units from different factions discovered that sharing information produced better outcomes than competing for it, then discovered that the information-sharing network they had built was more useful than any of the governments they had been serving. Pegasus is what persisted when those governments restructured after the war.

**Control methodology** is structural rather than visible: Pegasus does not occupy palaces or command armies. It places competent people in the information flows that governance depends on, ensures that decisions favorable to Pegasus's objectives are made before they reach public deliberation, and removes obstacles with the minimum intervention necessary. **Akison** and **Oredsy** are controlled in this way — their domestic governance is genuine, but the strategic ceiling is Pegasus-set.

The **Signal Harvest** annual convergence in Oniofast is the organization's communication backbone: in a world where no message system is trusted for sensitive intelligence, physical presence for reporting from all field operatives simultaneously is the only protocol that satisfies Pegasus's security standards. The event's existence is known. Its location is known. The contents of Signal Harvest reports are the most protected information in Criozevan.
