*They did not choose the dark. The dark chose them, when the crimson star burned away everything else.*

When the **Crimson Convergence** swept across Criozevan, the light was lethal to Elves — every elf it touched died instantly. Survivors fled beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains, into forests so ancient and dense that the red star's lethal radiance could not reach. Generations passed in near-total darkness, and over time those survivors remade themselves. Grey and obsidian skin absorbed the shadow. Eyes became bioluminescent — pale, eerily beautiful, capable of reading darkness as others read sunlight. Their ears elongated and carved themselves into elegant, angular shapes that channeled sound like natural instruments.

They became the **Darkmane Elves** — *Naelvari* in their own tongue — forest-dwellers forged by catastrophe into something simultaneously diminished and transcendent.

## Appearance & Traits

Darkmane Elves stand four to five feet — slight and agile, built for movement through dense undergrowth. Their grey-to-obsidian skin absorbs and diffuses shadow. Bioluminescent eyes — glowing amber, blue-white, or rarely deep violet — allow vision in near-total darkness. They live roughly 150 years, long enough to accumulate grievances across centuries, short enough to feel the urgency of clan survival.

## Culture & Society

Darkmane culture is defined by *poison rites*, *blood-bond rituals*, and *soul binding* — practices that bind individuals to their clan through magical and biological ties. Factions have developed in isolation: ambush clans who speak only through Nualthyr; reclusive pacifists who reject the old war-doctrine; poison-brewers who have turned toxicology into artistry.

Society is tribal, governed by the eldest living **Darkmane family** member — a principle that was stable until the family itself fractured. Trial-by-duel settles disputes in some regions; in others, the eldest simply commands and is obeyed or abandoned.

Their religion is ancestral spirit worship with no central priesthood. Each clan interprets omens independently, consulting the shades of notable ancestors through rituals involving blood and old-growth tree resin.

## The Darkmane Family & The Fallen

The **Darkmane Family** once unified the entire dark elf realm. Internal corruption crept into the family's highest ranks over generations, and eventually some members were consumed by the corrupted rune energy that permeates the deep forest — becoming *The Fallen*: soulless, dark-magic-possessed husks who retained the shape of the elves they had been, but nothing of their minds or wills.

Other family members exiled The Fallen, but the damage was done. The realm collapsed into a collection of warring tribes. Legend holds that the Fallen still haunt the old forest — that travelers who get lost in the deep woods will be taken by them, their memories erased, their bodies becoming Fallen vessels.

**Vaelith the Hollow** is the most notable surviving Darkmane family figure — her epithet referring to whether she herself carries the hollow that precedes The Fallen, or whether she earned it through loss.

## Magic & Technology

Darkmane Elves draw *corrupted energy* from abandoned Golem runes scattered deep in the forest — runes the **Golem King** once maintained but has since abandoned. Unstable and prone to explosion, these runes still pulse with dark magic that can infect the mind. Elves with the affinity to draw from them gain abilities including: **Shadowstep** (instantaneous short-range translocation through shadow), **silence binding** (suppressing sound within a radius), and **toxin shaping** (manipulating and concentrating poisons remotely).

## Combat Doctrine

Guerilla warfare. Traps laid weeks or months in advance. Poison-laced daggers applied so subtly that targets may not know they've been struck until hours later. Stealth doctrines passed orally through training clans. Animal familiars — forest creatures bonded through blood rites — serve as scouts and weapons.

They avoid open-field combat entirely. A Darkmane Elf who is seen has already made a mistake.

## Current Status

Strongholds remain in **Grousea** (de facto capital, a criminal hub), **Wrediff** (hidden warrior training ground), and **Vlurg** (black market town). **Adlens** holds a rare peaceful community of dark elves who have rejected violence, living alongside Golems and Goldhelm exiles.

The realm is declining. Internal infighting consumes resources and lives. Magic corruption spreads. Cultural memory erodes as the old families continue to fracture.
