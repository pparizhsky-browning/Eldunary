summary: "Forest-dwelling dark elves, marked by grey skin and bioluminescent eyes. Fractured by internal corruption."
---

Forest-dwellers of northeastern Criozevan. Unified under the Darkmane Family until internal corruption split the realm and created The Fallen.

**Features:** Grey/obsidian skin, bioluminescent eyes, carved ears.

The light of the Crimson Convergence was lethal to Elves — every elf it touched died instantly. Surviving elves retreated into the thick forests beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains. Over generations, they evolved into the Darkmane Elves.

**Culture:** Poison rites, blood-bond rituals, soul binding. Factions: ambush clans, reclusive pacifists, poison-brewers.

**Social Structure:** Tribal warbands led by eldest living Darkmane family member. Some regions use trial-by-duel.

**Magic / Tech:** Draw corrupted energy from abandoned Golem runes. Abilities: Shadowstep, silence binding, toxin shaping.

**Combat:** Guerilla warfare, traps, poison-laced daggers. Stealth doctrines and animal familiars.

**Relations:** Distrusted by Goldhelms, avoided by traders. Uneasy pacts with certain Arashi members.

**Religion:** Ancestral spirit worship. No central priesthood; each clan interprets omens independently.

**Language:** Nualthyr (clan-dialects with tonal variance). Spoken secretly among elves who do not wish to be understood.

**Status:** DECLINING — Strongholds: Grousea, Wrediff. Threats: internal infighting, magic corruption, cultural collapse.
