Formerly Folkwynd; diverged genetically and culturally after the Crimson Convergence. A subset of early Folkwynd discovered they carried the Devourer ability — a hereditary power to passively drain magic from living sources. Terrified of the harm this caused those they loved, they fled to the northeastern peninsula and founded what would become the Goldhelm Kingdom. The anti-magic ban and the development of holotech both trace directly to this founding trauma. Over a thousand years, the original shame was buried and the ideology was inverted into supremacy. The true history is sealed in the royal archive; the general public — and King Aldric himself — do not know it. See: The Goldhelm Exodus (History) and Devourers (Magi Types).
