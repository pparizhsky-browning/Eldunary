*Every Goldhelm child is taught the same origin myth: their ancestors looked at magic and chose not to submit to it. They chose to surpass it.*

The **Goldhelms** — *Solari* in their own refined Solaran-script tongue — did not always exist as a distinct race. They were once Folkwynd, the common human lineage of Criozevan. The divergence was not biological accident but ideological design: a civilization so committed to order, precision, and technological supremacy that over generations it physically, culturally, and genetically remade itself.

## Appearance & Traits

Goldhelms stand over six feet — noticeably taller and more broadly built than average Folkwynd. Their most striking features are **golden eyes** — a trait that appeared within a few generations of the race's ideological divergence — and **ivory-blond hair** paired with fair, almost luminous skin. These features are so consistent that Goldhelms born outside the kingdom are immediately identifiable.

They live roughly a century, and spend that century in relentless pursuit of social ascension.

## Culture & Society

Goldhelm society is built on a four-tier caste: *Citizen → Officer → Ascendant → Architect*. Social mobility is possible, even expected, but it requires achievement — military service, scientific contribution, or demonstrated excellence in assigned work. The obsession with rising through the hierarchy is simultaneously Goldhelm culture's greatest strength and its central dysfunction.

They are deeply **isolationist**. Outsiders are not merely unwelcome — they are viewed as lesser, potentially contaminating. The kingdom's geographic position, surrounded by natural water barriers and controlled crossings, reinforces this psychology. A Goldhelm who leaves the kingdom and returns changed is treated with deep suspicion.

Holidays: **Holo-tech Day** celebrates the invention of holotech — the single achievement Goldhelms consider their greatest contribution to Criozevan. **Founding Day** commemorates the establishment of the kingdom in Ovodon, viewed as the moment the Solari became more than humans.

## Magic & Technology: The Anti-Magic Nation

Magic is **completely banned** inside the Goldhelm Kingdom. Use is punishable by *public execution*. This is not mere law — it is theology. The Path of Radiant Order holds that magic is surrender: an admission that the user cannot achieve through skill and intellect what a rune or incantation can achieve through supernatural shortcut.

**Holotech** — holographic and photonic technology developed over centuries — serves every function that magic serves elsewhere. Holo-war axes that can cut stone, holo-armor that deflects physical and limited magical damage, holo-shields that project force fields, holo-tech bows, hover-rails for transportation: the Goldhelm Kingdom functions entirely without magic, and thrives doing so.

The secret underground labs in **Ibeson** suggest that some experimentation continues beyond public doctrine — what exactly is being tested beneath Ibeson's streets is known only to the Goldhelm government.

## Military

The army mirrors Roman formations in tactical design: **Brutes** (heavy frontline, holo-war axes), **Archers** (holo-tech ranged), **Swordsmen** (standard infantry), **Spearmen** (anti-cavalry), and **Medics** (holotech-based field support). Coordinated holo-units operate on tactical grids. Flanking, shield-wall, and coordinated encirclement are the doctrines of the **Auric Vanguard**, Goldhelm's military force.

## The Golden War

**The Golden War** was a civil war between the North and South of the kingdom — between Ovodon and Ibeson. Its causes and precise history are not documented in full in public records; the kingdom's government has suppressed detailed accounts. What is known: the war was fought, and the north won, reinforcing Ovodon's position as the political seat and the gilded Cradle as the throne of the Goldhelm Family.
