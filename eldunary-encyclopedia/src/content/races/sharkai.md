---

*The sea does not negotiate. The sea takes what it wants, and gives back only what it chooses. The Shar'kai understood this long before they understood language.*

The **Shar'kai** — *Vra'tan* in their own guttural Ka'torr tongue — are the sea incarnate: powerful, unpredictable, and magnificent in the way that something genuinely dangerous is magnificent. Their lineage connects to the Ipadoras through ancient evolutionary branching, but the two peoples have diverged into tension more than kinship. Where Ipadoras are fluid and patient, Shar'kai are direct and relentless.

## Appearance

Six to eight feet of cartilage-reinforced muscle. **Serrated teeth** — rows of them, constantly cycling new growth from behind the old. **Dorsal fins** rising from the upper back. **Gill slits** along the neck that allow underwater breathing. Skin that is simultaneously armor: rough cartilage ridges that won't stop a blade but will slow one.

Most critically: **contact with blood triggers a frenzy state**. Their own or others', it does not matter. This is not weakness or dysfunction — it is their most feared combat trait, the reason mercenary contracts with Shar'kai explicitly specify non-lethal engagement scenarios. Once blood appears, the contract changes.

They live roughly sixty-five years. It often feels like not enough time to prove what needs to be proven.

## Culture & Society

**Honor-by-hunt** is the governing philosophy. Prestige is accumulated through the trophies of kills — not displayed morbidly but presented in diplomatic contexts, as evidence of capability. A Shar'kai presenting a trophy to a foreign dignitary is not threatening them; they are introducing themselves.

**Clan-ships** are the primary social unit — vessels large enough to house a full clan, mobile enough to follow prey and trade routes. Each clan-ship is ruled by a **Captain**, the most effective hunter and commander. **Elders** serve as storm-priests, interpreters of the Crimson Fin's will through weather patterns, current changes, and the behavior of prey.

Rituals: *blood tides* (in which clan members enter frenzied water together to bond through shared frenzy experience, emerging either closer or having culled the weakest); *storm feasts* (celebrations of successful hunts or battles, held during natural storms for thematic resonance).

## Relations

Feared by merchants. Revered by islanders who once literally worshipped them as sea gods. The Ipadoras maintain a *tense truce* with the Shar'kai — they share water, share roots, and share certain enemies, but the Ipadoras find the Shar'kai culturally erratic and the Shar'kai find Ipadoras insufferably slow.

**Rabuka** — Arashi member ranked #4, known as the Demon Shark — is the most internationally notorious Shar'kai alive. Born and abandoned in **Glaril**, an underwater city off the coast of Akison, he became a bloodthirsty killer through survival, then learned swordsmanship and magic through means never disclosed. He has killed over a thousand people. He has been arrested by the Crimson Rooks multiple times and escaped or been released each time. He is both the most famous Shar'kai and the one the rest of the race is most often judged by.

## Magic & Combat

**Surge magic** — elemental power linked to oceanic currents — is the Shar'kai magical tradition. Weapon-forged teeth and sonar-sculpted blades are their armament. In combat: blitz tactics, underwater ramming charges, bite combat that bypasses weapon defenses, trident barrages, and water drill spirals (rotating underwater attacks that generate shredding pressure waves).

They hold multiple locations in sea zones, with concentrations in **Glaril**, **Neruvalis**, coastal Akison, and pirate fleet routes.
