**Magic / Tech:** Immune to mind control. Use organic biotech grafted into body armor.

**Combat:** Silent ambushers using group tactics. Echo-sense, venom bursts, self-sacrifice explosions.

**Relations:** Feared as monsters across Criozevan. Racial extermination was state policy in multiple kingdoms post-war.
