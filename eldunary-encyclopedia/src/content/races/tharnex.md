*In the deep desert of northern Fodon, where the sand remembers every footfall in silence, there existed a people who understood that memory never truly dies — it only changes form.*

The **Tharnex** — called *Xynari* in their own clicking tongue — were born from Criozevan's harshest climate. Where other races sought shelter from the desert, the Tharnex became the desert: resilient, patient, and capable of striking without warning. Their segmented chitin bodies gleam like polished obsidian in sunlight, natural armor secreted from within, hardening over years into layered plates capable of deflecting steel.

## Appearance & Biology

A Tharnex stands between five and six feet, their build deceptively lean. Multiple eyes — arranged in a wide crescent across the upper face — give them near-total peripheral vision even in pitch darkness. Some carry vestigial wings, remnants of an older evolutionary line; others manifest venomous sacs behind the mandibles. Their lifespan is brutally short by the standards of other races: roughly thirty years, though Hive theology teaches that death is not ending but *transfer* — the memories of the deceased joined to the collective memory of X'zel.

The exoskeleton is not merely armor. It is text. Tharnexi — their spiral claw-glyph writing system — is etched directly into carapace plates, turning each Tharnex body into a living archive of lineage, deeds, and prayers. When a Tharnex dies, their body is not buried but preserved, their claw-glyphs read aloud in the *funerary echo chant* so that encoded memory can pass to those who remain.

## Culture & Society

Tharnex society was matriarchal, organized in a rigid caste system — *Queens*, *Sentinels*, *Drones*, and *Brood-Lurks* — each with defined roles in the Hive. Queens governed and bore the ancestral memory; Sentinels protected and enforced; Drones labored and crafted; Brood-Lurks performed reconnaissance and ritual sacrifice.

Their worship centered on **X'zel, the Hive Divinity of Memory** — a formless divine presence believed to inhabit the collective consciousness of all living Tharnex. Death was sacred: ritual *molting feasts* marked pivotal life stages, *combat dances* settled disputes without bloodshed, and funerary echo chants ensured no one's memory was lost.

## Magic & Combat

Tharnex are completely immune to mind control — their hive-linked neural architecture is too distributed for any single caster to seize. They fought through ambush and group tactics, exploiting echo-sense (a form of sonar-like environmental perception) to track prey through darkness and sand. Venom bursts could paralyze or kill. In extremis, Drones were trained in self-sacrifice explosions — detonating volatile biological compounds stored in their carapace.

They pioneered a form of *organic biotech*: grafting materials directly into body armor to enhance function, a practice no other race has replicated.

## The War of Fodon & Extinction

The War of Fodon was the beginning of the end. Racial extermination became state policy across multiple kingdoms in the aftermath of the war. Hunts were systematic. Hive strongholds in northern Fodon were destroyed one by one. The last known stronghold fell with the death of **Vorvax**, the Bug District matriarch of Fodon — rumored to be the last queen, whose shifting armor sensed incoming danger before any scout could warn her. When she fell to **Lucifer** of the Arashi, the remaining Tharnex perished.

One known survivor remains on Criozevan: **Vorryn, the Last Drone**. What he carries in his carapace-glyphs — what memories survive — is unknown to all but him.

*"All life is memory. All death is transfer."* This is both the prayer and the eulogy of the Tharnex. Whether X'zel received them all, or whether the last echoes of the Hive died in the desert sand, no one can say.
