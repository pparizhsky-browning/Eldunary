*Before kingdoms had names, before the mountains were carved, before the first rune was struck — the Ipadoras were already in the deep.*

The **Ipadoras** — *Velari* in their own fluid-script tongue — are among the oldest sapient peoples of Criozevan, their reef cities and coastal trading posts predating the first human settlement by a measure no historian has been able to determine. They did not build civilizations so much as grow them, the way coral grows: slowly, organically, each generation adding to structures the previous had laid.

## Appearance

The defining feature of an Ipadoras is their **tentacle limbs** — octopus-type appendages that serve as both arms and hands, with precision grip and enormous strength, capable of extending, contracting, and wrapping with the same dexterity human fingers manage. Their skin carries **chromatophores** — cells that shift color and pattern, used for emotional expression, camouflage, communication, and combat signaling. A calm Ipadoras shimmers like deep water. An enraged one pulses in patterns that trigger instinctive fear in most other races.

Sub-types exist: shark-people (*Shar'kai*) who share lineage and rough alliance; squid-people with more elongated builds and larger chromatophore coverage. All share flexible joints and **beaked mouths** — stronger than they appear, useful in close combat.

They live roughly eighty years, with a density of experience in each decade that makes them feel much older.

## Culture & Society

**Matriarchal**. Lineage is traced through sea rites — ceremonies conducted underwater at specific tide cycles that bind a child to their mother's clan history. The eldest Matron of each clan holds absolute authority within that clan; the **Queen of the Tide** (currently **Queen Nayele**) holds authority over all Matrons.

Values: *flow*, *intuition*, and *oceanic balance*. Decision-making is never rushed. Ipadoras diplomats are legendarily patient — they will wait out any negotiation, knowing that time is always on their side when the other party needs water access to survive.

Cultural highlights include **Tidal Harmony rites** (synchronized chromatophore displays performed in open water during specific celestial events), **ink-sigil messages** (complex chemical sigils pressed into surfaces that carry compressed meaning), and **coral festivals** (celebrating the growth and maintenance of reef infrastructure).

## Strategic Power: Water Control

Every waterway in Criozevan — rivers, sea lanes, underwater trade routes — is ultimately subject to Ipadora authority. All kingdoms that use waterways must pay taxes or gain explicit permission from the Ipadora Kingdom. This monopoly makes them economically and politically indispensable to every nation on the continent, regardless of what any of them think about Ipadoras personally.

The **Kingdom of Fodon** and the **Republic of Frada** challenged this monopoly directly, launching a massive war against Ipadora that drove them from mainland territory. In response, Ipadora cut a manmade river to physically and symbolically separate themselves from their former enemies. The water taxes continue.

## Magic & Technology

**Water-bending, bio-luminescent casting, and ink sigil memory** are native Ipadora magical traditions. Their integrated water-pressure technology and sonar glyphs represent one of the most sophisticated non-holotech engineering traditions in Criozevan. The underwater architecture of the **Ipadora Sanctuary** and **Glaril** demonstrates engineering that surface kingdoms have never replicated.

In combat: tridents, water jets, ink-based illusions, pressure pulse bursts, and grappling. Fighting an Ipadoras on land is hard. Fighting one in water is suicide.
