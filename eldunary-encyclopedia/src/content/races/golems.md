summary: "Immortal stone beings created by the Golem King. Live in Nikolem Kingdom. High rune magic affinity."
---

Created solely by the Golem King using ancient rune forges. No other being can replicate true sentient Golems. All are descendants of the Golem King.

**Culture:** Duty-bound, ritual-forging traditions. Emphasize utility, craftsmanship, and legacy. Fine with other races but do not fully accept them.

**Social Structure:** Guild-caste society based on purpose. Titles earned through creation, not blood.

**Magic / Tech:** High affinity to rune magic. Act as living batteries for enchanted gear. Nikolem Kingdom is rich in rune magic and forges.

**Combat:** Slow but overwhelming force. Natural stone armor, rune-powered fists, internal regeneration.

**Relations:** Respected for neutrality. Distrust those who exploit rune artifacts.

**Religion:** Worship the Golem King. No afterlife belief — legacy lives in crafted stone.

**Language:** Karthrun (chiseled glyph-code).

**Status:** STABLE — Threats: scarcity of creation materials, rogue rune hunters.
