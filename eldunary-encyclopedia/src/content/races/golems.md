*Stone remembers everything. The first Golems were born remembering millions of years.*

No one else made a Golem. No one else ever could.

The **Golems** — *Durakorr* in their chiseled glyph-code tongue — are not a race that evolved or adapted. They were **created**, each one individually forged by the **Golem King** in the ancient rune forges that honeycomb the mountains of Nikolem. Their bodies are formed from minerals unique to those mountains: dense basalt cores reinforced by crystalline composites, veined with living runes that pulse with faint blue-gold light. They stand eight to nine feet, and their presence fills any room they enter.

They do not age. They do not die unless destroyed. This makes them something no other race can fully comprehend — beings whose memory of history is not oral tradition or written record, but lived experience across centuries.

## Appearance & Construction

Each Golem is unique — the Golem King does not repeat patterns. Some are broad and hunched, built for raw force; others are narrow and precise, built for craftsmanship. All share the mineral-encrusted exterior, the rune veins that glow when they exert magical force, and the **core** — a concentrated rune crystal at their center that is effectively their soul. Destroy the core and the Golem does not sleep or weaken. It ceases.

**Karthrun** is their written language — chiseled directly into stone, used for contracts, histories, and prayers. It cannot be spoken aloud because Golems do not consider speech a reliable medium for important things. Only carved words carry weight.

## Culture & Society

Duty-bound and utility-focused, Golems organize themselves in a **guild-caste society** where titles are earned through creation, not bloodline. A Golem who builds a bridge of extraordinary precision outranks one who has merely existed longer. Legacy lives in stone — their only form of immortality that matters beyond the literal.

They do not worship death because they do not typically experience it. Instead, they revere the **Golem King** — not abstractly, as humans revere distant gods, but directly, as subjects revere a sovereign they can name a location for, whose voice they have (in theory) heard.

They are fine with other races — genuinely neutral in most conflicts — but do not *fully* accept any of them. The distinction between a Golem and a non-Golem is too fundamental to bridge with diplomacy. You are stone, or you are not.

## Magic & Rune Affinity

Golems are **living batteries for rune magic**. Their mineral bodies store and channel runic energy at a capacity no biological creature can match. The Nikolem Kingdom is a rune-rich environment specifically because the mountains are full of these beings, whose ambient presence amplifies magical potential in the stone and earth around them.

When a Golem strikes with a rune-powered fist, the impact carries both physical mass and concentrated runic discharge. They also possess **internal regeneration** — cracks in their stone bodies seal over time if they remain near rune-rich ground. Away from the mountains, regeneration slows and eventually stops.

## Current Tensions

Rogue rune hunters have increasingly targeted Nikolem's mountains, seeking to extract runestones and rune-charged minerals. The Golems monitor the entire kingdom; they act as both sentries and enforcers. Thieves who enter the mountain tunnels without proper escort tend not to return.

Some Golems have defected from the kingdom's strict social order — a small community lives in **Adlens** in the Warring Darkmane Realm, among dark elves who rejected violence and Goldhelm exiles. They are watched from afar by the Golem King, but not recalled.
