*The Crimson Convergence did not give the Folkwynd claws, or chitin, or tentacles, or the immortality of stone. It gave them adaptation. It gave them flexibility. Forty days of red light, and they became everyone who wasn't something else.*

The **Folkwynd** — *Vellan* in formal Common tongue — are Criozevan's most prevalent race. They fill the gaps other races leave. Where a Goldhelm sees hierarchy and a Tharnex sees the Hive, a Folkwynd asks: *what works right now?* This adaptability is their defining characteristic, and it is both why they thrive everywhere and why no single Folkwynd culture ever quite matches the intensity or depth of more specialized races.

## Appearance

Vastly diverse: skin tones from near-white to deep brown, hair from straight and dark to coarse and red, eyes in every configuration recorded. The only fixed trait is a height range of five and a half to six and a half feet, slightly narrower than the most extreme other races. A Folkwynd standing next to a Goldhelm is visibly shorter and less imposing. Standing next to a Tharnex in their chitin, they look disarmingly undefended.

They live roughly eighty-five years, long enough to accumulate real experience and skill, short enough to make youth feel urgent.

## Culture & Society

There is no single Folkwynd culture. The Common tongue is theirs, but regional variations have drifted to the point where a Folkwynd from Oredsy and one from Fodon may struggle to follow each other's idiom. Kingdom-level culture defines them more than race:

- In **Vacron**, Folkwynd are administrators, merchants, and Crimson Rook officers — rule-keepers and order-maintainers.
- In **Frada**, they are soldiers, engineers, and pragmatists who cite the national motto without irony: *"Fall in Line. Or Fall."*
- In **Akison**, they apprentice to masters and try to earn standing in a city that respects demonstrated ability over lineage.
- In **Oredsy**, swordsmanship and civic philosophy are taught simultaneously to children, as though one cannot be understood without the other.

Universal traditions include *oral epic chants* (long narrative songs performed at oath-feasts and civic events) and *oath feasts* (formal meals accompanying major declarations of alliance, enmity, or contract).

## Role in Criozevan

Folkwynd serve as diplomats because they belong everywhere and exclusively to nowhere. They understand that a Goldhelm needs to feel superior and an Ipadoras needs to feel respected, and they can navigate both within the same conversation. They staff most international trade — they are the brokers between a Golem merchant and a Shar'kai captain.

Their magic and technology use is *balanced* in every meaningful sense. They are not the best at any one school of magic, not the most advanced in any one technology. They are competent at everything and transcendent at nothing — unless individual Folkwynd push beyond that pattern, like the **Crimson Knight**, who sits at power rank #2.

**The Goldhelms** were originally Folkwynd before ideological divergence and selective breeding created a distinct race over centuries. This origin is not discussed openly in Goldhelm society, where the suggestion that they are merely evolved humans is considered an insult.
