summary: "The Tharnex hive language. Now spoken only by Vorryn, the last Tharnex. Primarily pheromone-based with a secondary written notation. The only externally accessible form is the written notation."
---

**Tharnexi** was not designed as a communication language — it emerged from the Tharnex hive biology as the system through which individual drones, queens, and the hive collective coordinated. Its primary medium is pheromone: complex chemical signals that carried information at bandwidths and speeds that vocal or written communication cannot approach within a functioning hive. The written notation system — **Hive-Pattern Script** — was a secondary development for inter-hive communication where pheromone dispersal was impractical across distances.

With **Vorryn** as the sole remaining speaker, Tharnexi survives in the written notation form and in the diminished pheromone communication capacity that Vorryn maintains, though without other Tharnex to receive his signals, the pheromone channel functions as an outbound transmission with no intended receiver. Scholars who have worked with Vorryn to understand the written notation describe it as among the most information-dense writing systems they have encountered — each symbol encodes not a sound or concept but a relationship state, and meaning emerges from the geometric relationships between symbols rather than their individual contents.

The language's documentation is almost entirely the work of Vorryn himself, who has allowed limited scholarly access over the centuries since the Tharnex extinction, producing a partial record that cannot be completed because the living transmission context — the hive, the queen-caste, the pheromone medium — no longer exists.
