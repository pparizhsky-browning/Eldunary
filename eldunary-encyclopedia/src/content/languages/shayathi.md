**Shayathi**: sacred language of the Kingdom of Iyhago. Used in worship, law, and magical casting. Built on tone, breath, posture, and silence as much as vocabulary.

Key terms: *sha* (balance), *thi* (form), *vala* (voice), *yunai* (silence), *eshar* (erasure).

**Kōtoba** is a refined form of Shayathi used only by the Resonant Guard. Unauthorized use of advanced Shayathi is forbidden and spiritually dangerous.
