summary: "The Darkmane Elf language. Shadow Script visible only in low-light. Used by criminal networks for information concealment. The written form is physically encoded to be invisible in daylight."

**Nualthyr** reflects Darkmane culture in its foundational design: the written **Shadow Script** uses inks mixed with void-adjacent compounds that are invisible in bright light and become legible in low-light or darkness conditions. Documents written in Shadow Script appear blank to anyone examining them under standard lighting. The linguistic implication — that the Darkmane built their writing system to be inherently secret from those who operate in daylight-normal conditions — is consistent with the Fallen Way period of their culture and has proven too practically useful to abandon even as Darkmane society evolved.

The spoken form is a mid-range tonal language with significant difference between registers: the formal register used in tribal council situations, the street register used in cities like Grousea, and the battle register — a shortened, high-precision form designed for communication under combat conditions where extended sentences are a tactical liability. Darkmane who move between these registers fluidly are operating in three different-sounding modes of the same language.

Criminal networks across Criozevan have adopted Nualthyr as a concealment language specifically for its written properties — documents, records, and correspondence in Shadow Script are useless to investigators who cannot read the script, and the script is rare enough outside Darkmane communities that investigators with the reading ability are not commonly available. Vlurg's black market operations are run in Nualthyr for exactly this reason.
