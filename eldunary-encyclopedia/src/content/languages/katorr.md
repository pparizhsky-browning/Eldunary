summary: "The Sharkai language. Tide-Script is pressure-carved and reads differently at different water depths due to compression effects. Maritime trade register widely used. Rabuka speaks it natively."

**Ka'torr** was built for underwater communication — the Sharkai evolved as a maritime species and their language reflects this completely. The spoken form uses pressure differentials in vocalization that function more efficiently underwater than in air; Sharkai speaking Ka'torr on the surface are slightly less precise than at depth, and non-aquatic listeners consistently have difficulty distinguishing tonal differences that carry meaning in the system.

The **Tide-Script** writing system is genuinely unique: carved into pressure-sensitive materials, the script reads differently at different water depths because the physical compression of the material alters which inscription channels are most prominent. A Tide-Script document read at the surface gives one message; the same document at fifty meters depth reveals a secondary message in the compression-amplified channels. This isn't steganography — it's a designed feature that allows Ka'torr texts to carry depth-specific information, relevant when the reading context determines which message applies.

The **maritime trade register** of Ka'torr has spread across Criozevan's coastal ports through Sharkai merchant activity — simplified forms of the spoken language that work adequately above water for basic transactional communication. **Wrofast's** harbor community uses it alongside Sailor Speak as one of the primary non-common trade languages, and Sharkai merchants are found in every significant coastal city on the continent.

**Rabuka** speaks Ka'torr as his first language and common as a functional second. His Ka'torr is notably formal in register for someone operating in criminal contexts — a characteristic that those who have interacted with him remark on as the most obviously Glaril-origin quality he retains.
