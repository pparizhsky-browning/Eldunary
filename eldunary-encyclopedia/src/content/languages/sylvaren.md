summary: "The forest Folkwynd dialect/language. Branch-Script echoes natural growth patterns. Primary language of Imuton's tree-dwelling communities. Used for ecological documentation and forest knowledge transmission."
---

**Sylvaren** developed among the Folkwynd communities that built permanent settlements in forest environments — most significantly the population that eventually founded **Imuton**, where living inside trees produced a culture deeply attuned to forest ecology and a language that grew to reflect that attunement. The **Branch-Script** writing system uses curves and bifurcations that echo plant growth patterns, making Sylvaren documents visually distinguishable from any other writing system in Criozevan at a glance.

The language has accumulated an exceptional ecological vocabulary over its development: specific terms for hundreds of distinct forest conditions, plant-communication states, soil quality indicators, and seasonal markers that common language requires multiple words to approximate. Imuton's herbalists and forest scholars working in Sylvaren can encode a complete ecological assessment of a forest area in a passage length that common language would require pages for, because every relevant variable has a direct lexical item.

Outside forest communities, Sylvaren is primarily of academic interest to ecologists, herbalists (Kusamori's practitioners have a significant borrowing vocabulary from it), and linguists interested in the relationship between a community's environment and the linguistic structures that emerge from it. Ace shows particular interest in operatives with Sylvaren fluency for the patient observational skills that extensive forest immersion tends to develop alongside the language itself.
