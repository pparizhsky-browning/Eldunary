summary: "The Golem language and the inscription system for runestone magic. The written form is the spoken form — Karthrun exists primarily as inscription. Varnokh is the primary living linguistic authority."

**Karthrun** is the only language in Criozevan where the written and spoken forms are genuinely equivalent rather than representations of each other — because Karthrun was designed as inscription first. The Golem King created it as a system for encoding will, identity, and behavioral parameters into stone, and the patterns that encode a Golem's consciousness are the same patterns that literate Karthrun-speakers use for communication. A Karthrun inscription is simultaneously a sentence, a magical operation, and (if inscribed into a Golem) a piece of cognition.

Golems speak Karthrun vocally through a vibration system in their stone forms that reproduces the acoustic patterns of the inscription sequence — they are, in effect, vocalizing their own rune-structure when they speak. This gives Karthrun a grounding quality when spoken: the meaning of each word is not symbolic but structural, because the words are the same patterns that define the physical reality of the speaker.

For non-Golem runestone scholars, learning Karthrun is the academic route to advanced runestone practice — the inscription language for other stone types derives from Karthrun's principles, and fluency in the foundational system accelerates mastery of the derived applications. Most runestone practitioners learn enough Karthrun to use; **Varnokh** is the authority on what the full language can do, which is a substantially larger set.
