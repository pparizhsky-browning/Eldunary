**Sailor Speak** is a maritime creole spoken natively in Wrofast and understood functionally by experienced sea traders from Glaril, Neruvalis, and Ipadora Sanctuary. It emerged organically over centuries of contact between Wrofast's fishing and trading communities and the Ipadoran sailors who long dominated the eastern sea lanes. Its two parent languages are Common — the continent's shared tongue — and Sylvaren, the fluid-script language of the Ipadoras and Shar'kai. Neither parent is dominant; Sailor Speak draws from both and belongs fully to neither.

## Structure

The grammar is simplified from both parent languages. It favors short declarative sentences, drops articles almost entirely, and uses a compressed tense system that distinguishes only three states: *done*, *doing*, and *will do*. Verb conjugation is minimal — tense is established by context and a handful of marker words derived from Sylvaren. Word order is flexible in simple statements but fixed in commands, which are always verb-first: *Cast line. Watch stern. Give berth.* Questions are formed by intonation alone — the sentence structure does not change, only the rise of the final syllable.

## Vocabulary

Split along functional lines. Common provides the structural skeleton — personal pronouns, numbers, directional words, and the names of goods. Sylvaren supplies the maritime lexicon almost entirely: every word for weather, current, depth, tide, wind direction, and sea condition comes from Sylvaren, a practical inheritance from the Ipadoran sailors who charted those waters first. A Wrofast sailor speaking Sailor Speak might use Common to say *I'll take two* and Sylvaren to specify *veluri* (deep-current cargo) or *zhaleth* (the particular chop of a crosswind sea). Someone fluent in Common alone can follow the broad meaning of a conversation but will be lost the moment conditions on the water become relevant — which, at sea, is always.

## Sound

Designed for noise. Consonants are hard and clipped; vowels are broad and easy to distinguish across a pitching deck in a strong wind. Syllables rarely exceed two beats, and any Common word of three or more syllables has almost certainly been shortened to fit. The result is a language that sounds blunt and rhythmic to outside ears — punchy, direct, and efficient. Long words are considered a luxury that salt air does not permit.

## Social Function

Among sea traders, Sailor Speak is not merely practical — it is a signal. Speaking it fluently, with the cadence and register a Wrofast sailor would recognize, indicates you have spent genuine time at sea among the people who work it. A merchant who arrives at port armed with a handful of borrowed Sylvaren terms and no feel for Common's compression is recognized immediately. Trust is a currency in Wrofast's harbor, and Sailor Speak is how it is spent. Traders who cannot speak it are not turned away, but they pay more, wait longer, and are told less.
