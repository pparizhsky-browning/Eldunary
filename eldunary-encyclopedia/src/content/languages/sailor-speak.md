**Sailor Speak** has no native speakers, no written form, no academy, and no authority — it is a language that exists entirely through use, maintained by convention among the communities that need it, and found wherever ships converge from different language backgrounds. It is, by geographic distribution, the most widely encountered language in Criozevan despite having none of the formal institutional support that regional languages receive.

The origins in **Wrofast harbor** are documented — the earliest records of recognizable Sailor Speak vocabulary and structure date from the harbor's peak trade period, when Ka'torr Sharkai merchants, Ipadora traders surfacing at coastal ports, Folkwynd shipping crews, and Goldhelm export agents were simultaneously trying to conduct transactions without a shared language. Sailor Speak is what they negotiated toward from all directions simultaneously, and what emerged was stable enough to spread.

The lexicon covers the domains that maritime communities actually need: weather, navigation, cargo, payment, emergency, medical basics, and the social vocabulary of shared spaces (ships, harbors, dockside establishments). It does not cover political discussion, emotional nuance, or technical complexity — those require switching to a fuller language. Sailor Speak is not a complete language; it is a functional bridge between complete languages.

The absence of a written form is not a limitation for its users — the oral transmission model means that regional variation accumulates over distance, such that Sailor Speak in Wrofast and Sailor Speak in Glaril have vocabulary drift that signals origin, which experienced practitioners use as geographic information. A speaker's Sailor Speak tells you where they learned it, which tells you where they've been.
