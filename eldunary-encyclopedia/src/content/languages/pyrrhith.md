**Pyrrhith** is the spoken language of Zhuiburn, spoken by no other community on the continent and voluntarily taught to no outsider. Its origins are unknown. The few linguists who have attempted to study it from the outside have done so at significant personal risk and produced only partial records, all of which agree on the same essential character: Pyrrhith does not share meaningful structural ancestry with Common, Sylvaren, Tharnic, or any other documented language in Criozevan. Whether it predates the Crimson Convergence or emerged from some long-extinct regional dialect is not known.

## Phonology — The Consonant Foundation

Pyrrhith is built almost entirely from fricatives and plosives. A *fricative* is a sound produced by forcing air through a narrow channel, creating friction — hissing, buzzing, or breathy sounds. A *plosive* is produced by building up and then abruptly releasing air pressure — a pop, a snap, a hard break. Pyrrhith uses almost nothing else. Nasal consonants — sounds made with closed or partially closed airflow, like *m* and *n* — are nearly absent from the language. Pyrrhith does not hum. It does not carry. It hisses, bursts, and breathes.

The dominant sounds:

- **Voiceless glottal fricative** — the hard exhaled *h*, as at the start of *heat* or *hollow*. In Pyrrhith, this sound functions as a full consonant, not merely an onset marker. It appears at the beginning, middle, and end of words. Many Pyrrhith words open or close on an audible breath, giving the impression that the speaker is exhaling the word as much as speaking it.
- **Voiced alveolar fricative** — the *z* sound. Used heavily in middle and closing positions. It gives the language a persistent low buzzing undercurrent beneath its sharper sounds — a sustained resonance that keeps individual words from feeling completely clipped.
- **Voiceless alveolar fricative** — the *s* sound, often extended and drawn through a word like air under pressure finding a narrow gap. Where most languages use *s* as a brief, incidental sound, Pyrrhith treats it as a full-weight syllable component.
- **Voiced bilabial plosive** — the *b* sound. Appears as a hard punctuating break, typically following a fricative. Where Common or Sylvaren might soften a word's end with an open vowel, Pyrrhith closes it with a *b* or a hard breath-stop. The effect is that words feel sealed — contained — rather than trailing off.
- **Compound fricative clusters** — combinations such as *zbh*, *szh*, and *hzs* are common within single words. These clusters are the feature most disorienting to outside listeners, who expect consonants to separate. In Pyrrhith they stack.

## Vowels

Vowels in Pyrrhith are minimal and uniformly short. They exist primarily to prevent adjacent consonant clusters from becoming unpronounceable, not to carry meaning. Most outside listeners perceive only three: a broad *ah*, a clipped *eh*, and a short *ih*. Vowel length never varies. There is no vowel harmony and no long vowel system. The language's meaning lies entirely in its consonant structure.

## Prosody

Pyrrhith is spoken at a low, even intensity. There is no rising intonation for questions — interrogatives are marked by a closing *h* or hard *b* at the end of a phrase. Stress falls consistently on the first syllable of each word. The language does not encourage emphasis through volume. Pyrrhith speakers do not raise their voices when pressing a point. They lower them. Loudness in Pyrrhith is considered a form of incoherence. Silence, in contrast, carries the weight that other languages place on emphasis.

To an outside listener, a spoken Pyrrhith phrase registers as something burning quietly and deliberately — not a roar but a sustained, controlled combustion. There is breath and sharpness and low buzz, and then it stops cleanly, like a flame cut off from air.

## Written Form

A written form exists but is not accessible to outsiders. It is held exclusively within Zhuiburn and is not shared.

| **Status** | Spoken only by the people of Zhuiburn. No translation resource exists. No outsider has produced a verified written record. Contact with Pyrrhith speakers is rare and typically not voluntary on their part. |
