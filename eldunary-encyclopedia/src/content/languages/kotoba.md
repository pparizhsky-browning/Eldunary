**Kōtoba** is the scholarly language that survived the transition from Iyhago's pre-kingdom period as a living tongue specifically because it has a function that Common and Shayathi cannot replace: spoken Kōtoba has a documented amplifying effect on malefici casting. The phoneme sequences in Kōtoba's structure resonate with the malefici substrate in ways that other languages do not, producing measurably stronger effects from the same energy input when the practitioner vocalizes in Kōtoba rather than another tongue.

This makes Kōtoba not merely a language of historical prestige but a practical magical tool — which is why Veles uses it as his primary language and why serious malefici practitioners in Iyhago and beyond dedicate significant study to it. The amplification is consistent, reproducible, and significant enough to affect power comparisons between practitioners of otherwise similar ability levels.

The **Spiral Script** uses concentric circle notation — meaning radiates outward from a core concept in concentric rings, with each ring encoding a level of contextual meaning. Reading a Spiral Script text is a process of understanding from the inside out, which mirrors the language's philosophical framing: clarity emerges from the center, context from the periphery, and the relationship between them is the complete meaning.

Biruda's Akison training included Kōtoba exposure — Sunlee's Iron Path curriculum acknowledges the language's magical applications even in a combat-focused context. Whether Biruda retained it after leaving Akison is unconfirmed; what is known is that his time in Iyhago-adjacent training contexts gave him more contact with Kōtoba than most Arashi members would have.
