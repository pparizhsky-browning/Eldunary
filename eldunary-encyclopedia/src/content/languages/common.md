summary: "The continental trade and diplomatic language. Spoken as first or second language by every race. No native advantage — Folkwynd humans developed it as a neutral trade medium. The default language of government, commerce, and inter-faction communication."

**Common** is the language that everybody speaks and nobody owns, which is precisely what makes it work. No single race, kingdom, or organization controls the standard — it emerged from centuries of trade contact between communities that needed a neutral exchange medium, evolved through the contact zone of every major city where multiple linguistic communities overlap, and stabilized into the continental standard that is now the default for diplomatic communications, commercial contracts, and any situation where the parties involved do not share a native language.

Folkwynd humans were the primary development community — their adaptability and their historical role as traders and migrants across every part of Criozevan created the social pressure for a neutral medium that they would not be perceived as controlling. Common's neutrality is structural: it borrowed vocabulary from every major language in Criozevan's linguistic landscape (Ka'torr maritime terms, Karthrun technical terms, Nualthyr structure idioms, Solaran engineering vocabulary) such that no native speaker of any component language is advantaged beyond the vocabulary their specialty contributed.

The language's **simplicity** compared to any native language is a feature: Common was trimmed through use to the grammar and vocabulary that cross-cultural communication actually needs, removing the specificity that serves native communities but creates barriers for learners and translators. This makes Common less expressive than any native tongue for specialized purposes and more accessible than any native tongue for general ones.

Every organization uses Common for inter-organizational communication. Every diplomatic document is issued in Common with native language translations as needed. It is, in the most practical sense, the infrastructure language of Criozevan's political life.
