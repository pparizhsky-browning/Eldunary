summary: "The Goldhelm technical language. Circuit Script is modular and assembly-based — ideal for engineering documentation. Restricted export alongside holotech. Kaboom and Helm brought it outside Goldhelm borders."

**Solaran** is a technical language — evolved from the Goldhelm ancestral tongue into a specialized form optimized for engineering documentation, equipment specification, and the precise communication required when building systems where inaccuracy has immediate physical consequences. The **Circuit Script** writing system is modular: individual script-blocks encode components, relationships between blocks encode assembly logic, and the complete script for a holotech device functions both as language and as engineering blueprint simultaneously.

The Goldhelm Kingdom restricts Solaran export alongside its technology restriction — learning Solaran requires access to Goldhelm educational resources, and Goldhelm educational resources are not distributed outside the Kingdom's borders. This means that understanding holotech at the engineering level, beyond the reverse-engineering approximations that Frada achieved, requires either a Goldhelm education or a person who had one and left.

**Kaboom and Helm** are the principal vectors by which Solaran technical knowledge has reached any outside party. Their departure from Ibeson with Goldhelm-level engineering knowledge intact means that the organizations they interact with have access to technical communication that Goldhelm's export controls assumed they wouldn't. The Arashi's internal engineering capability is significantly described by this fact.
