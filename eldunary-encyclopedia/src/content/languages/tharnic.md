summary: "The Oredsy Republic language. Edge Script is angular and decisive — each stroke is committed with no revision marks. Grammatically structured around action and result rather than description. Selvarin's native tongue."

**Tharnic** is structured around a grammatical principle that reflects Oredsy's sword-philosophy: every sentence is built action-first. The subject acts, the result follows, the context is trailing. Describing a situation before describing what was done about it is grammatically awkward in Tharnic and culturally uncomfortable in Oredsy — it suggests hesitation, contextual hedging before commitment, which both the language and the society regard as weakness in communication as in combat.

The **Edge Script** writing system enforces the same aesthetic: each character is formed with angular, committed strokes that do not curve back or revise. A practiced Edge Script writer does not lift and reposition — the pen commits to direction and maintains it. Documents in Tharnic look sharp and definitive even when the content is nuanced, because the script form encodes commitment regardless of semantic content.

**Selvarin** speaks Tharnic as his native language and Common as a functional second. His Common is grammatically clean but clearly organized around the Tharnic sentence structure — action prominent, result explicit, context subordinate. Those who understand Tharnic recognize this immediately; those who only hear his Common find it unusually direct and occasionally blunt beyond what the content requires. He does not perceive this as a problem.

Tharnic has spread beyond Oredsy's borders primarily through the dueling culture that Oredsy exports alongside its practitioners — swordfighters who train in Oredsy and then operate elsewhere bring enough Tharnic vocabulary and sentence structure into their Common usage that a linguistic community of practitioners across Criozevan speak what might be called Combat Common, the Tharnic-influenced register that Edge Script origin speakers share.
