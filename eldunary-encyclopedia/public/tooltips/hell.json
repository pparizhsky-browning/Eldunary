{"name":"Hell","type":"magic","summary":"Hell is a separate dimension — not a metaphor or theological construct, but a real place physically distinct from Eldunary that can be accessed through specific dark magical practices. Hell Malefici (approximately 2% of Dark Malefici) specialize in opening connections to this dimension for summoning purposes. What governs it and what its inhabitants want are unknown. Berserk (#2 Arashi) made a direct pact with a being from this dimension.","accentColor":"#1a0000"}
