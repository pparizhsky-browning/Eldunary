{"name":"Fall of the Darkmane Kingdom","type":"history","summary":"The unified Darkmane Realm collapsed between 937 and 940 ACC following the betrayal of Vaelith the Hollow, head of the ruling Darkmane Family, who sold his own brother Thalrith to a Goldhelm scientist. The act created the first of the Fallen — dark-magic-possessed husks — and shattered the family's internal trust beyond repair. By 940 ACC, a realm that had existed for centuries fractured into the warring tribes it remains today.","accentColor":"#4A2D6B"}
