{"name":"Fluffy — The Fourth Appearance","type":"history","summary":"During the Fradan re-occupation of Ipadoran territory (901 ACC), Fluffy appeared above one of the burning settlements. It did not prevent the atrocities. But in that settlement, in that hour, the killing paused. Fluffy left. The account was suppressed by Fradan command. It survives in Ipadoran oral tradition with complicated bitterness: Fluffy came, and then it left.","accentColor":"#FFFFFF"}
