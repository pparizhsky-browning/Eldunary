## **3. Goldhelms**

| Common Name | Goldhelms |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Endonym** | Solari |
| **Exonyms** | Lightbloods or Goldhelms |
| **Height** | 6+ ft (taller than average Folkwynd) |
| **Features** | Golden eyes, ivory-blond hair, fair skin |
| **Lifespan** | ~100 years |
| **Origin** | Formerly Folkwynd; diverged genetically and culturally after the Crimson Convergence. A subset of early Folkwynd discovered they carried the Devourer ability — a hereditary power to passively drain magic from living sources. Terrified of the harm this caused those they loved, they fled to the northeastern peninsula and founded what would become the Goldhelm Kingdom. The anti-magic ban and the development of holotech both trace directly to this founding trauma. Over a thousand years, the original shame was buried and the ideology was inverted into supremacy. The true history is sealed in the royal archive; the general public — and King Aldric himself — do not know it. See: The Goldhelm Exodus (History) and Devourers (Magi Types). |
| **Homeland** | Goldhelm Kingdom (Northeastern peninsula of Criozevan). Rare exiles in Akison, Frada, or Oredsy. |
| **Culture** | Value order, perfection, and advancement. Known rituals: Light Ascension, Unity Chant. Celebrate Holo-tech Day and Founding Day. |
| **Social Structure** | Technocratic caste: Citizen → Officer → Ascendant → Architect. |
| **Magic / Tech** | Anti-magic. Sole developers of holotech — tech that mimics magic. Magic is banned under penalty of public execution. The publicly stated reason is cultural and ideological superiority. The true reason — that the royal bloodline carries the Devourer ability and the ban was originally designed to prevent magic users from being passively drained — is classified at the highest level of the royal archive and unknown to all living Goldhelms. |
| **Combat** | Division-based: Brutes, Archers, Swordsmen, Spearmen, Medics. Coordinated holo-units, tactical grids, Roman-army attack style. |
| **Relations** | Treat others as inferior. Border conflicts with Darkmanes. Political hostility with Ipadora. |
| **Religion** | Path of Radiant Order (no belief in rebirth). Priesthood functions as national ideal enforcers. |
| **Language** | Solaran (tech script); Common as secondary. |
| **Notable Figures** | King Aldric  •  Princess Seraphina (see: Families of Power / Major Characters) |
| **Status** | STABLE, MILITARIZING — Threats: internal rebellion, Arashi espionage. |

| **Magic / Tech** | High affinity to rune magic. Act as living batteries for enchanted gear. Nikolem Kingdom is rich in rune magic and forges. |
| **Combat** | Slow but overwhelming force. Natural stone armor, rune-powered fists, internal regeneration. |
| **Relations** | Respected for neutrality. Distrust those who exploit rune artifacts. |
| **Religion** | Worship the Golem King. No afterlife belief — legacy lives in crafted stone. |
| **Language** | Karthrun (chiseled glyph-code). |

## **Languages**

### **Sailor Speak**

- **Type:** Pidgin trade language
- **Parent Languages:** Katorr (Shar'kai), Common (Folkwynd), loanwords from Shayathi (Iyhago), Pyrrhith (Darkmane), and various coastal dialects
- **Primary Users:** Sailors, dock workers, coastal merchants, pirates, port city populations
- **Geographic Spread:** All coastal settlements and trade ports on Criozevan; dominant at sea
- **Script:** None. Entirely oral. Occasionally written phonetically using Common script by literate speakers.

Sailor Speak emerged from the need for fast, reliable communication across ships and docks where crew members come from every race and kingdom. It prioritizes clarity and brevity over grammar. Full sentences are rare. Imperatives, nouns, and directional cues dominate. Tone and gesture carry roughly 40% of meaning.

**Structure:** Subject-drop is standard. Verb tense is signaled by adverbs (*before, now, after*) rather than conjugation. Negation is pre-verbal (*no sail south* = "we will not sail south"). Questions are formed by rising intonation alone. There are no gendered pronouns — all people are *ta*.

**Social Function:** Sailor Speak has no homeland and no prestige — it is no one's mother tongue and everyone's emergency tongue. Knowing it marks you as someone who works with people from everywhere, which carries its own informal credibility on the water. Refusing to use it in a port context is read as arrogance.

**Status:** Alive and evolving. New Goldhelm holotech terms have entered the lexicon in the last generation. The version spoken near Akison has absorbed more Katorr, while the version near Glaril uses heavier Ipadoran loan-sounds.

---

### **Pyrrhith**

- **Type:** Living language (endangered)
- **Speaker Population:** Darkmane Elves — concentrated in surviving Darkmane settlements; diaspora communities in Grousea, Adlens, Vlurg
- **Script:** Pyrrhith Runic — angular, carved notation designed for stone and bark. Ink versions exist but are considered informal.
- **Relation to Other Languages:** No known structural relatives. Pre-dates the Crimson Convergence. Its phonological roots diverged before the Convergence and was not meaningfully influenced by it.

Pyrrhith is built on a consonant foundation — five dominant sounds (*vr, thk, al, dun, ss*) recur at a disproportionate rate across its vocabulary, giving it a characteristic texture that most non-speakers describe as grinding or low. Vowels are short and unstressed; they serve as connective tissue between consonant clusters rather than as stressed syllables. Prosody is falling — sentences begin loud and high, then drop. Questions do not rise; they fall harder.

**Written Form:** Pyrrhith Runic was designed to be cut, not drawn — the angular forms are an artifact of carving. Ink writing using Pyrrhith Runic is technically correct but considered informal or impermanent by speakers.

**Status:** Endangered. The internal collapse of the Darkmane Realm following the Betrayal of Vaelith the Hollow (937–940 ACC) displaced much of the population and disrupted transmission of the language to younger generations. Diaspora communities maintain partial use, but full fluency is declining. No formal institutional support exists for preservation.

# **III.  History**

## **The Dragon Era (Pre-Convergence)**

Long before the Crimson Convergence — thousands of years before the calendar began — the world of Eldunary was dominated by dragons. These were not mindless beasts but powerful, intelligent creatures with deep awareness of the world around them. However, they were solitary by nature. They built no cities, formed no governments, and left behind no written records. Each dragon carved out vast territories across the continents, and their presence alone shaped the landscape — scorching valleys, hollowing mountains, and splitting coastlines.

During this era, two primordial beings also existed: the entity later known as **Fluffy** and the being who would become the **Golem King**. Both are believed to have been born or created around the same time as the dragons themselves, at or near the very origin of Eldunary. Their exact nature and relationship during this period is unknown, but they are said to have known each other for all of time. Both entered a state of dormancy long before the Crimson Convergence — the Golem King sleeping deep within what would become the Jagged Mountains, and Fluffy withdrawing from the physical world entirely.

The Dragon Era ended not through natural decline but through annihilation. A mysterious entity known only as **The Shadow** appeared without warning and systematically hunted and killed every dragon on the planet. The Shadow's origin remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in Eldunary — theories range from an invasion by a more advanced civilization on a distant continent to an incursion from another dimension entirely. What is known is that The Shadow was powerful enough to destroy beings that had ruled unchallenged for millennia, and that after completing its slaughter, it vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. It has never been seen again.

Only one dragon survived: **Zunarorth**, who managed to escape and hide from The Shadow. His survival and the circumstances of his escape remain unknown to all but himself. The extinction of the dragons left an enormous power vacuum in the world — one that would not be filled until the Crimson Convergence reshaped all life on Eldunary thousands of years later.

## **The Age of Elves (Pre-Convergence)**

In the long era between the extinction of the dragons and the Crimson Convergence, elves dominated Criozevan. They were not a fractured or primitive people — they had built a vast, advanced civilization that spanned much of the continent, ruling unchallenged and uncontested. No other species could rival their reach or organization. The elf civilization of this period represents the last great pre-Convergence society, far larger and more powerful than anything built in the thousand years that followed.

During this same period, the being who would become the **Golem King** was dormant deep within the mountain range now known as the Jagged Mountains. Elven explorers venturing deep enough into the rock sometimes discovered him — an enormous, ancient figure sleeping in the dark. Those who found him did not know what he was, only that his presence was wrong in a way they could not name. They grew frightened and left without disturbing him. No record of these encounters survives in the current era; they are known only through fragmentary legend.

When the Crimson Convergence came, its lethal light struck the elves hardest of all — every elf it touched died instantly. Those who survived did so only by retreating into the deepest, most shadowed forests, far beneath the canopy where the Convergence light could not fully penetrate. Their great civilization was obliterated in 40 days. From this remnant population, over generations, the Darkmane Elves emerged. The vast architecture, records, and accumulated knowledge of the pre-Convergence elf civilization were lost entirely.

## **The Crimson Convergence**

The Crimson Convergence is the defining cosmological event of Eldunary — the moment from which all years are measured (ACC = After Crimson Convergence).

- A red star appeared in the sky over Eldunary for exactly 40 days.
- The star drew magic out of the earth and condensed it into tangible forms — primarily runes.
- The light caused millions of years of evolution to occur in just 40 days, radically altering all species.
- Humans evolved into Folkwynd.
- The light was lethal to Elves. Every elf it touched died instantly.
  - Surviving elves retreated into the thick forests beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains. Over generations, they evolved into the Darkmane Elves. This region is now known as the Warring Darkmane Realm.
- Magic flooded from the earth into the mountains, awakening the Golem King from millions of years of slumber.
- Both the Golem King and Fluffy had existed since the Dragon Era, long before the Convergence. The Convergence did not create them — it awakened the Golem King from his ancient dormancy deep within the Jagged Mountains. Fluffy's reawakening, if it occurred at the same time, was not publicly observed.
- Humans in certain distinct climates evolved differently from the Folkwynd baseline — giving rise to the Tharnex, Ipadoras, and Shar'kai.
- When the star finally vanished, the new calendar began. All subsequent years are counted from this moment.

All maps of Criozevan are dated to Year 1000 ACC.

## **The Goldhelm Exodus**

In the years immediately following the Crimson Convergence, as the newly transformed Folkwynd began spreading across Criozevan, one family discovered that their reshaping by the red star's light was unlike any other. Where the Convergence gave most Folkwynd outward powers — magic to cast, abilities to wield — this family's transformation was inward and invisible. They did not gain a power so much as a hunger.

The ability — recorded in the sealed Goldhelm royal archive as the Devourer power — works passively and without intent. In its dormant state it is a slow ambient drain: magic users in proximity to a Devourer find their abilities imperceptibly weakening over time, their reserves depleting faster than they should. The Devourer feels nothing. The victim feels only a creeping loss they cannot explain. Under emotional extremity in the carrier — grief, fear, anger, love — the drain becomes acute and potentially lethal to a magic user's power. In the worst cases, a magic user drained completely never recovers their abilities. In some recorded instances, they did not survive the loss at all.

The founders did not discover this ability through study. They discovered it through grief. The first confirmed catastrophe: a young woman in the founding family fell in love with a Folkwynd mage. Over the course of a year, without either of them knowing why, she drained him to nothing. He died ordinary — his power gone, his body hollowed by its absence. She understood what she had done only after it was too late. Other losses followed. The pattern became undeniable. The surrounding Folkwynd communities, watching magic users weaken and die near this family without explanation, began to fear and then hunt them.

They fled. Not in arrogance — in shame. The northeastern peninsula, surrounded on most sides by ocean and separated from the continent by water barriers, offered isolation. The anti-magic ban was their first act of governance: if no one in the kingdom uses magic, no one can be drained. Holotech was developed over generations precisely to replace magic in all its practical functions — healing, defense, communication, industry — so that no citizen would ever need to be a magic user, and therefore no citizen would ever be at risk from their rulers.

The kingdom was designed, from its very foundation, to make the royal family's power irrelevant.

It worked, for centuries. But founding shame does not stay buried. Political leaders across generations found the ban convenient for reasons beyond its original purpose: control, isolationism, the manufacture of racial superiority. The archive was sealed. The true history was reclassified, then forgotten. What began as *we must protect you from us* became *we are above those who need magic.* The guilt calcified into ideology. The wound became a weapon.

A single inscription remains above the sealed archive door in old Solaran, which no living Goldhelm scholar has correctly translated. It reads: *"We left so that you would live."*

No living person currently knows the full history. King Aldric does not know it. Lady Isolde does not know it. The only individual with reason to suspect the truth is Anton — and what he has pieced together, and why, is a matter of ongoing investigation by the Crimson Rooks.

## **The Formation of Kingdoms (c. 500–700 ACC)**

For the first five centuries after the Crimson Convergence, the peoples of Criozevan lived in loose tribal groupings with no formal centralized authority. Communities formed and dissolved along ethnic, geographic, and magical lines, but none consolidated into anything resembling a state. Around Year 500, informal proto-kingdoms began emerging across the continent — territories held together by shared race, shared land, or a powerful individual's influence — but these were still fluid, without fixed borders or formal governments.

The first true centralized government on the continent was created by the **Goldhelms**. Around Year 700, the Goldhelm people — who had long held their isolated northeastern peninsula but remained internally tribal — coalesced under a unified ruling structure and founded what would become the Goldhelm Kingdom. Their consolidation acted as a catalyst: as the Goldhelms pulled inward and stopped engaging with other groups, the surrounding peoples recognized that organized government was not only possible but necessary for defense and trade. Over the following decades, formal centralized governments began forming across the continent in rapid succession, each partly in response to Goldhelm's precedent and partly out of the need to negotiate with it.

## **The Golden War (795–c. 800 ACC)**

The first major continental conflict of the post-Convergence era, and the event that defined the political shape of the continent for the next two centuries.

#### **CAUSE**

In Year 795, the southern territories of the Goldhelm Kingdom revolted. The underlying cause was political: the Goldhelm central government, based in the north, had grown increasingly detached from — and dismissive of — the southern population. The south demanded greater autonomy and representation. The north refused. Open rebellion followed.

#### **ALLIANCES**

The war drew in the continent's major powers almost immediately, splitting them along lines of interest rather than pure ideology.

- **North Goldhelm** was backed by the Republic of Frada, which had strong economic ties to the Goldhelm crown.
- **South Goldhelm** was backed by Shimaguni (the territory now called Akison), which saw in the revolutionaries a cause for greater continental freedom.

The three **Masters** — the most powerful individuals alive — were also drawn in, each for different reasons:

- **Veles** joined the South. He believed the revolutionaries' fight for freedom was a genuinely noble cause, and he committed his full power and reputation to their side.
- **Selvarin** joined the North — not out of political conviction, but because the Goldhelm northern government was helping him forge a new sword, and he honored the relationship.
- **Sunlee** attempted to stay out entirely, traveling between factions trying to broker peace. He failed. Eventually, his refusal to let either side hold the moral high ground by standing unopposed drew him into open conflict with both. He fought not for a side but against the idea that the war itself was acceptable.

#### **THE EQUINOX OF POWER**

The decisive engagement became known as the **Equinox of Power** — a three-way battle between Veles, Selvarin, and Sunlee that escalated beyond all control. The Masters' confrontation obliterated the armies around them: **500,000 soldiers died across all three factions** in that single engagement. The battle ended in a total stalemate — not one Master could defeat the others. When the fighting stopped, the destruction around them was so total that they chose, silently, to end it. None of them ever fought each other again.

The battle created a **massive crater** in the earth. The city of **Ibeson** was later built on and around this crater, with the Goldhelm government constructing their most sensitive underground research laboratories in the caverns beneath it.

#### **AFTERMATH**

Most of the southern Goldhelm revolutionaries died in the final engagement or its immediate aftermath. The Goldhelm Kingdom retook the south, re-establishing central control. The revolution failed.

But the three leaders who had backed opposing sides each built something from the ruins:

- **Sunlee** was elected head of the **Republic of Shimaguni** — the territory that had backed the south — by a population that respected his attempt to end the war over his participation in it. He renamed the republic the **State of Akison** and governed it under the doctrine of the Iron Path.
- **Selvarin** united the collection of smaller independent territories that had formed near the town of Oredsy, consolidating them under a single flag and founding the **Republic of Oredsy**.
- **Veles**, already a widely respected and well-known figure born in Iyhago, was voted to the throne by his people following the war. He then quietly and steadily expanded the Kingdom of Iyhago's territory over the following decades to its present borders.

## **The Founding of the Crimson Rooks (712 ACC)**

The Crimson Rooks were founded in **Year 712**, at the same time as the formal establishment of the **Kingdom of Vacron** as a centralized state. The organization grew slowly over the following centuries, accumulating influence, political capital, and reach across every kingdom on the continent. By Year 1000, they had become the closest thing to a neutral peacekeeping authority in Criozevan — neither a government nor an army, but an institution capable of operating in the space between both. Their headquarters remains in Vacron, the largest and most centrally located city on the continent.

## **The War of Fodon (820–847 ACC)**

A prolonged civil conflict inside the **Kingdom of Fodon**, now remembered as one of the most violent internal wars in the continent's history.

#### **ORIGINS**

In the years before the war, Fodon's four districts — Bug, Magic, Death, and Fire — were governed by their own leaders in a state of deep mutual suspicion. The **Tharnex** (insectoid race, called the Xynari in their own tongue) were the primary inhabitants of the Bug District, and their rapid reproduction rate and tendency to spread across all four districts produced a severe cultural backlash. Other districts began demonizing the Tharnex — spreading stigma, restricting their movement, and treating their presence as a territorial threat. This discrimination escalated into active persecution as district tensions grew.

In **820 ACC**, the accumulated hostilities between district leaders erupted into open warfare. The war lasted **27 years**, concluding in 847.

#### **VORVAX AND THE BUG DISTRICT**

During the early phase of the war, Tharnex were killed in large numbers across all districts. The massacre nearly destroyed them entirely. In the chaos, a Tharnex leader named **Vorvax** rose to prominence — promising protection for all surviving Tharnex, ruling with personal courage and exceptional strategic intelligence. Under her leadership, the Bug District fortified itself and stopped admitting outsiders. Vorvax became one of the most feared district leaders on the continent, known for her shifting armor that detected incoming threats and her absolute refusal to compromise on the safety of her people.

#### **END OF THE WAR — LUCIFER'S MOVE**

In **847 ACC**, the war's conclusion was triggered not by any diplomatic settlement but by a single act of targeted violence. An individual operating to prove himself to the shadowy figure known as **#0** — seeking to earn the rank of **#6** in what would become the Arashi organization — decided that killing the Fodon district leaders would demonstrate sufficient power for the position. All four district leaders were among the most dangerous individuals alive at the time. He killed them all. This event ended the War of Fodon by eliminating every faction's leadership simultaneously. The killer took the position of **#6**. His name, now known: **Lucifer**.

With the district leaders dead, the survivors eventually constructed the **Dune Accord** — Fodon's current governing system — from the wreckage. See: Kingdom of Fodon for details.

## **The Formation of Pegasus and Rose (738–780 ACC)**

**Pegasus** was founded in **Year 738** with a genuinely idealistic purpose: to unite the many small, warring independent territories across the continent and broker lasting peace between them. The organization succeeded. For approximately thirty years following its founding, Pegasus maintained a period of continental stability unprecedented in the post-Convergence era.

The collapse was internal. As the organization's purpose shifted from peacemaking to maintenance, it required financial contributions from member nations to continue operating. A faction of senior Pegasus agents recognized the opportunity and began systematically redirecting those funds for personal gain. This group climbed to leadership positions and held control of the organization for **six years** while the theft continued. When member nations discovered what was happening, they withdrew from Pegasus en masse. The organization lost its legitimacy and its mandate simultaneously.

**Rose** was created in **Year 780** specifically to combat Pegasus — to counter its influence, prevent it from recovering its membership, and ensure that no other nation could be convinced to rejoin or fund it. The two organizations have been at war ever since. Strikes occur almost weekly across the continent in the ongoing conflict between them. Pegasus operates its current covert base in Oniofast. Rose maintains its leadership meetings in Anehull and its headquarters in Uyrand.

## **The Ipadora Land War (c. 900 ACC)**

By **Year 900**, the **Ipadora Kingdom** had completed its long campaign to control all of eastern Fodon up to the river bordering Frada — the largest territorial expansion in the kingdom's history. From this position, Ipadora began aggressively taxing both Frada and Fodon for access to the waterways adjacent to Ipadora-controlled territory, as well as for land passage rights across their expanded borders. The fees grew increasingly punitive over the following years.

As Ipadora continued pushing its expansion toward Fodon city, a criminal in Ipadora territory killed a Tharnex belonging to Fodon's Bug District. The Fodon leadership interpreted the killing as a deliberate act of aggression — a signal that Ipadora was escalating toward open war. They declared war on Ipadora.

#### **THE CONFLICT**

The war exposed the fundamental weakness of Ipadora's military doctrine: their army is built for the sea and underwater combat, not land warfare. Against a two-front conflict — **Frada's** rigid, disciplined army pressing from one direction, and **Fodon's** massive and ethnically diverse population pressing from another — Ipadora was unable to defend its vast inland border effectively. The kingdom lost a significant portion of its most resource-rich inland towns and the shoreline access that accompanied them.

In response, Ipadora's military engineers **deliberately constructed a new river** as a strategic defensive boundary — designed to give the kingdom a natural underwater chokepoint that could be defended from below. This manmade river became the formal dividing line between Ipadora's remaining territory and its former holdings.

#### **AFTERMATH**

The towns Ipadora lost were absorbed into Fodon. Small numbers of Ipadoras remain scattered through those settlements, but they are a minority and largely isolated from the main kingdom. Ipadora itself retained its island sanctuary, its control of all major sea lanes, and its water-taxation system — meaning it lost territory but not economic power. The kingdom remains one of the most strategically vital forces on the continent.

## **The Arashi (c. 950 ACC)**

The age of the **Arashi** as an organization is unknown — the identity and origins of **#0**, its founder and ultimate authority, remain completely unresolved. The organization was formally designated a terrorist entity by continental authorities approximately **50 years before the current era** (roughly Year 950). What existed before that designation — whether the Arashi operated informally for years or decades prior, or whether they were founded close to the date of their designation — is not publicly established. See: Arashi Members for individual profiles.

## **The Five Public Appearances of Fluffy**

In the one thousand years since the Crimson Convergence, Fluffy has been publicly sighted only five times. Each appearance is treated as a sacred historical event by those who witnessed it.

**1. The Dragon Era (Pre-Convergence):** Fluffy's earliest confirmed presence — observed by dragons and primordial entities. Documented only in fragmentary pre-Convergence records. No living witness.

**2. The Crimson Convergence (Year 0):** Fluffy was present during the Convergence itself. What role it played, if any, is not known. It did not intervene to stop it. This appearance is the source of Fluffy's status as a divine figure among magic users — it is believed that Fluffy's presence at the moment all magic was restructured is meaningful, though no one knows how.

**3. The Equinox of Power (795 ACC):** Fluffy appeared during the three-way stalemate of the Masters — the battle between Sunlee, Selvarin, and Veles that ended the Golden War. No one witnessed an intervention. Fluffy was simply observed, watching. After the three Masters chose peace, Fluffy left, gifting the Crimson Knight his indestructible blazer as recognition of his peacekeeping work. The timing — appearing precisely at the moment peace was chosen rather than forced — is cited by scholars as evidence of Fluffy's nature.

**4. The Ipadora Atrocities (901 ACC):** Fluffy appeared during a period historians label the Ipadora Atrocities, the worst phase of the Ipadora Land War. The exact nature of this appearance is disputed — some accounts state Fluffy appeared and immediately left without acting; others describe a brief magical phenomenon in the area coinciding with the appearance. Because Fluffy made no recorded statement or action, its presence remains unexplained. This is the most controversial of the five appearances; some scholars question whether it occurred at all, as documentation is thinner than for the others.

**5. The Northern Earthquake (957 ACC):** Fluffy was sighted in the northern reaches of Criozevan during a catastrophic seismic event. No action was recorded. Fluffy was witnessed observing the destruction, then departed. The earthquake's cause remains unknown; its connection to Fluffy's presence has never been established.

## **The Wizard Uprising *(c. 880–890 ACC)***

The Wizard Uprising was a decade-long insurrection by revolutionary Malefici — specifically a large coalition of non-Scarlet magic users who believed the established magical hierarchy was extracting power from practitioners while offering them no political representation or protection. The uprising is one of the bloodiest internal conflicts in post-Convergence history, producing an estimated six million dead over its ten-year span.

#### **ORIGINS**

The grievances that produced the Uprising had been accumulating for generations. Magic Societies, while nominally representative, functioned in practice as gatekeeping institutions — controlling access to training, licensing, and protection. Revolutionary cells formed independently across three kingdoms before connecting in the early 880s ACC. The trigger event that united them is contested; most historians cite a specific incident of state suppression in Fodon, though others point to earlier events in Vacron.

#### **THE CONFLICT**

At its peak, the Uprising involved over one hundred coordinated revolutionary cells operating across five kingdoms. The Master of Magic, Velho, was the primary figure tasked with negotiating a resolution — he was one of the few institutional authorities that multiple factions on both sides still regarded as potentially neutral. He secured correspondence with more than one hundred revolutionary Malefici leaders over the course of the conflict.

#### **THE FIRST FIRE AND ANTON (885 ACC)**

An early and particularly destructive incident in the Uprising's middle phase — now referred to as the First Fire — marked Anton's emergence. Anton was almost certainly a leader within the revolutionary movement, though his specific cell affiliations remain undocumented. The First Fire is the event that made Anton's name known. Following the incident, and apparently in response to increased institutional pressure, Anton went into hiding. He became an operative for the **Butterfly organization**, funneling resources, intelligence, and coordination support to revolutionary cells while maintaining anonymity.

#### **VELHO'S DEATH AND THE COLLAPSE (889 ACC)**

In 889 ACC, Velho offered personal compromises to over one hundred revolutionary Malefici leaders in a direct attempt to end the conflict without further bloodshed. He was killed. The exact circumstances of his death are not fully documented. The effect, however, was immediate and decisive: the killing of the one figure who had credibility across both factions fractured the revolutionary coalition. Without the prospect of peace talks, the more moderate revolutionary factions lost their justification for continued action. The Uprising collapsed within two years. **Velho's resurrection** — whether by himself or by another — is not known. He later appeared as a founding member of the Arashi, now ranked #5.

## **The Mist Family Massacre *(993 ACC)***

The Mist Family Massacre refers to the total killing of every member of **the Mist family** — a Folkwynd noble line who served for generations as the de facto ruling family of Wrofast (Republic of Oredsy), holding the town's informal leadership through maritime wealth, local authority, and institutional presence in the port's commercial and legal systems.

#### **THE MIST FAMILY**

The Mist family were not a royal family in any formal sense, but in Wrofast's practical governance, the family head was the closest thing the town had to a ruler. They operated as an assassination-tradition household — internal succession resolved through strength, and weakness within the family was not tolerated. They maintained their hold on Wrofast for generations and survived multiple periods of regional instability by eliminating internal threats before they could consolidate.

#### **NEBBIO'S RETURN (993 ACC)**

Nebbio — born into the Mist family but rejected during childhood as too weak to carry its name — returned in 993 ACC. He had left Wrofast under humiliating circumstances, a departure the family treated as non-existence. Upon return, he assassinated his father (the family head) first, then killed every remaining member of the household. He left Wrofast ungoverned — not destroyed, not absorbed, simply emptied and abandoned. He departed without claiming any title or territory. Wrofast has had no formal noble leadership since. He is now ranked **#3 of the Arashi**. See: Arashi Members.

## **Goldhelm Kingdom**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Capital — Ovodon: A large city on the northeastern peninsula, dominated by a towering castle dubbed the 'Gilded Cradle,' where the Goldhelm royal family resides. Not friendly to outsiders.
- Ibeson: Scientific capital of Criozevan. Hosts many public and private labs. Secret underground experimentation conducted by the Goldhelm government. Built above and around the massive crater created by the Equinox of Power (795 ACC) — the three-way battle of the Masters that ended the Golden War. The Goldhelm government constructed their most sensitive underground research laboratories in the caverns beneath the crater.

  **The Underground Research Facility:** The sub-crater facility is home to the **Department of Holometric Advancement** — the primary research arm of the Goldhelm government. Officially, the facility focuses on medical holotech, environmental sciences, and structural engineering applications. In practice, its scope expanded gradually into weapons development and experimental creature-creation programs. The expansion was incremental and deliberate — each stage small enough to be buried within existing budget allocations. Advancements produced here led to breakthroughs in holometric medical science, defensive barrier technology, and destructive weaponry well beyond what the public Goldhelm military holds. **Kaboom** was created in this facility as a destructive weapon prototype and escaped, later joining the Arashi. The facility's full scope remains classified under multiple layers of Goldhelm state secrecy.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Lightly hilly terrain with thin, sparse forests.
- Surrounded by ocean on most sides. A heavily fortified river divides the kingdom: Ovodon to the north, Ibeson to the south.
- Isolated from the rest of the continent by natural water barriers and controlled crossings.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- Monarchy with a council of advisors from each sector: Scientific, Military, Maritime, Merchants Guild, Northern Criozevan Diplomat, and Southern Criozevan Diplomat.
- Currently ruled by King Aldric (see: Families of Power / Major Characters). Ideology: Technocratic Isolationism.

#### **MILITARY**

- Brutes: Heavy frontline fighters — holo-tech war axes, multi-layered holo-armor, holo-shields.
- Archers: Ranged units — holo-tech bows and arrows, light holo-armor.
- Swordsmen: Standard infantry — holo-tech swords and armor.
- Spearmen: Anti-cavalry and defensive — holo-tech spears and shields.
- Medics: Healers using holotech-based support systems.
- Attack style mirrors Roman army formations. Uses natural water barriers and tech for defense.

#### **MAGIC & TECHNOLOGY**

- Magic is completely banned inside the kingdom. Use is punishable by public execution.
- Holotech is used in place of magic for everyday life, warfare, and industry.

#### **ECONOMY & TRADE**

- Autarky (self-sufficiency) is the national economic goal. All trade is restricted except with the Republic of Frada.
- Exports scientific findings and research exclusively to Frada.
- Infrastructure: Hover-rails, stone roads, and bridge networks.

#### **CULTURE & SOCIETY**

- Highly elitist. Citizens are obsessed with rising through the social hierarchy.
- Deeply isolationist — outsiders are viewed as lesser beings.
- Holidays include Holo-tech Day (celebrating the invention of holotech) and Founding Day (commemorating the establishment of the kingdom in Ovodon).

#### **KEY ORGANIZATIONS**

- Department of Holometric Advancement — scientific arm of the government.
- The Auric Vanguard — Goldhelm's military force.
- Goldhelm Maritime Trade and Defense Corps (MTDC) — controls rivers and seas, regulates trade.
- Imperial Merchants Guild — government-run guild for regulated trade inside Goldhelm and Frada.

#### **NOTABLE HISTORY**

- **The Golden War (795 ACC):** In Year 795, the kingdom's southern territories revolted, demanding greater autonomy from the northern-dominated central government. The north refused, and civil war broke out. Frada backed the north; Shimaguni (now Akison) backed the south. The three Masters were each drawn in for different reasons — Veles for the southern cause of freedom, Selvarin honoring an alliance with the north, and Sunlee attempting (and failing) to stop the conflict before joining it. The war's climactic engagement — the Equinox of Power — was a three-way battle of the Masters that killed 500,000 soldiers and carved a massive crater into the earth. Ibeson was subsequently built above this crater, with Goldhelm's most sensitive underground laboratories constructed in the caverns below it. The revolution ultimately failed: most southern revolutionaries died in the final engagement, and Goldhelm retook full control of the south. See: The Golden War (History).
- **The True Founding:** The anti-magic ban and the development of holotech are publicly attributed to Goldhelm cultural superiority and the rejection of primitive practices. The actual reason — that the founding royal family carried the Devourer ability and designed the entire kingdom to prevent harm to magic users in their proximity — is sealed in the oldest section of the Gilded Cradle archive. The archive door bears an inscription in old Solaran that has never been correctly translated by modern scholars: *"We left so that you would live."* See: The Goldhelm Exodus (History).

## **Warring Darkmane Realm**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Grousea (informal capital): Extremely shady and dangerous city. Considered the de facto capital despite no formal designation. A major criminal hub.
- Vlurg: Black market capital. Town centered around its market. Dark elf population speaks Nualthyr when they don't want to be understood.
- Wrediff: Hidden training ground for dark elf warriors. Shielded by dark elf magic — rarely seen or entered by outsiders. No markets or trade — only forges, shrines, and poison-makers. Locals speak only Nualthyr.
- Adlens: Diverse town of peaceful people — dark elves who reject violence, Golems who defected from the Golem King, and Goldhelms who fled corruption. Large port. Trade hub from GK to the southeast by boat. Peace treaty signed here.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Dense, ancient forest. Filled with hidden dangers, ambushes, and old ruins.
- Elven warfare has permanently scarred the land. Corrupted runes are scattered deep in the forest.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- Not a centralized government. A collection of scattered, warring tribes and villages.
- Constant infighting defines the realm.

#### **MILITARY**

- Tribal warbands. No unified army. Each clan fields its own warriors trained in guerilla tactics.

#### **MAGIC & TECHNOLOGY**

- Dark elves draw corrupted energy from abandoned Golem runes deep in the forest.
- Abilities include: Shadowstep, silence binding, and toxin shaping.
- Corrupted Runes: Massive, unstable runes left by the Golem King. Became unstable after the Golem King stopped maintaining them because of the ongoing war. Prone to explosions. Emit dark magic that can infect the mind — often fatal.

#### **CULTURE & SOCIETY**

- Extremely secretive. Rarely interact with outsiders except during major wars.
- Poison rites, blood-bond rituals, and soul binding define cultural practices.

#### **THE DARKMANE FAMILY & THE FALLEN**

- The Darkmane Family split due to internal corruption. Some members became 'The Fallen' — soulless, dark-magic-possessed husks.
- Other family members exiled The Fallen, causing complete societal collapse.
- Legend says The Fallen still haunt the woods. Rumors hold that if you get lost in the forest, they will take you.

#### **NOTABLE LOCATIONS**

- Abandoned Goldhelm Outpost: Deep within the Darkmane forest lie the ruins of a former Goldhelm military outpost. Years ago, the Goldhelm Kingdom attempted to maintain a strategic presence inside Darkmane territory. The outpost was abandoned when the Darkmane Realm became increasingly volatile and dangerous — the constant infighting between elven tribes and the spread of corrupted runes made the position untenable. Today, only broken buildings and remnants of old fortifications remain. The site is occasionally used as a waypoint by those traveling through the forest, but it offers no safety — the Darkmane elves have passed through repeatedly, and no garrison has held it since.

## **Nikolem Kingdom**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Suudon (Capital): City in the Golem Swamp, home of the Golem King. Not hostile but unfriendly to visitors. Shrouded in mist. Houses a vast underground network rumored to extend beneath the Great Lake. A secret underground city is rumored to exist below.
- Cridbury: Built into the foothills of the Jagged Mountains. Home to many Golems and miners. Famous for strong metal and rare minerals. Training center for heavy weapon users. Outsiders without a guide often get 'lost' in the tunnels.
- Klosdon: Forest rest stop in the middle of Nikolem. Golems live peacefully here. Few visitors, fewer rules. Known for strange glowing plants at night.
- Phaaross: Bridge city into Vacron. Strong Golem military presence. Stone wall facing Vacron. Watchtowers on all sides. Trade hub connecting northwest to northeast.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Mostly mountainous terrain — steep, jagged cliffs and deep caverns.
- Some tunnels are rumored to reach the core of Eldunary.
- Swamps surround Suudon.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- The Golem King resides in the largest, most isolated mountain. Difficult to reach due to natural defenses and elevation. The kingdom effectively operates under his will.
- Golems actively monitor the entire kingdom — acting as both sentries and enforcers.

#### **MAGIC & TECHNOLOGY**

- The kingdom is rich in rune magic. Known for their forges where rune users train, acquire Runestones, and craft infused gear.

#### **INFRASTRUCTURE**

- Contains a vast underground tunnel network connecting the northernmost mountains to Suudon near the Great Lake.

## **Kingdom of Vacron**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Vacron (Capital): The largest and most populated city on the entire continent of Criozevan. Located at the geographic center of the continent. Known for its towering administrative buildings and bustling marketplaces. A key location for law, politics, and power deals. Hub for trade and commerce. Extremely strict punishments for breaking the law. Friendly to outsiders. HQ for the Crimson Rooks and residence of the Crimson Knight.
- Clocester: Former mining colony turned town. Known for crystal caverns and unstable ground (frequent collapses from underground duels). Tunnel access to KoF, RoF, and KoI borders. Mixed population of refugees and runaways. Home to a neutral forge with Rose protection. Criminal meeting ground. Central spot between Vacron, Sloumont, and Hiypolis. Town militia uses salvaged war-tech.
- Klanron: Peninsula between two rivers. Butterfly HQ. Meeting point for all Magic Societies. Population is 90% magic users. Friendly to visitors — changes when non-magis try to stay permanently.
- Anehull: Ghost town rebuilt into a resort. Former Arashi campaign battleground. Rose leaders use it for covert meetings. Locals profit from war relic tourism. Under constant Crimson Rooks surveillance. Magic dampeners active at all times. Rumors of hell malefici sightings.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Located at the geographic center of Criozevan. Built around river valleys, forming a natural continental crossroads.
- Important central location connecting north, south, east, and west trade routes.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- Highly diverse population. Strict legal code with harsh, efficient punishment for lawbreakers.
- Famous for its order, stability, and no-nonsense leadership.

#### **TRADE & INFRASTRUCTURE**

- The economic heart of Criozevan. Maintains border access and trade routes to several kingdoms. Friendly to outsiders as long as the law is followed.

#### **KEY ORGANIZATIONS**

- Crimson Rooks HQ: Heavily fortified compound within the city. Guarded by elite officers and surveillance technology. The Rooks act as world peacekeepers, often enforcing order where governments collapse. They operate independently but are deeply rooted in Vacron's political system. Many citizens see them as both protectors and watchers.

## **Kingdom of Fodon**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Fodon (Capital): The second largest city in Criozevan. Located on the northwest peninsula. Arid, desert climate next to the sea. Originally divided into four war-torn districts — Bug, Magic, Death, and Fire. The districts fought for decades until Lucifer (#6 Arashi) killed all four district leaders. Now a diverse but tense metropolis marked by old ruins and district pride. Still carries the legacy of violence and survival in its streets and politics.

- District Leaders (now deceased):
  - Vorvax (Bug): Rumored to be the last matriarch of the Tharnex. Ruled from the shadows with shifting armor that sensed incoming danger. She trusted no one but her own. Her eyes missed nothing, and her will to protect the scattered bugfolk was legendary. In a city built on betrayal, Vorvax was the one presence you never saw coming — until it was far too late. Once she was killed, the rest of the Tharnex race perished.
  - Azaraith, the Nightweaver (Magic): Feared ruler of the Magic District. Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces with her staff, her power pulsing like a hidden current beneath the city's sands. No one knows what lies behind her mask, but every rumor agrees on one thing: to speak her name is to tempt fate. She judges all magic users with merciless precision, and even the Arashi once hesitated to challenge her rule.
  - Varnokh (Death): A towering armored construct powered by a magenta arcane core. His armor resembled a spiked exoskeleton, and he wielded a massive scythe-axe linked to necromantic energy. Known for his silence and ceremonial law, Varnokh ruled without emotion through death rituals and executions. His core was destroyed by Lucifer (#6 Arashi) during the fall of the districts. His body was never recovered.
  - Vulkran (Fire): A knight of molten steel and volcanic power. Wielded a lava-blade and obsidian shield, with a burning eye-core at his chest. His armor could melt sand into glass. Vulkran was slain by Lucifer (#6 Arashi) during the collapse of the Warring Districts. His remains lie entombed in a fire-cracked canyon near Plodrough — still warm to this day. Born in Zhuiburn.

- Mayson: Desert town in the Kingdom of Fodon. Crypt-based desert town with layers of burial tunnels and ruins.
- Plodrough: Desert town built into a canyon. Canyon-side underground city, carved vertically into the cliffs.
- Sloumont: Dry plains farming town. Expansive. Near a river. Small agricultural port with a small river port for trade.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Northwestern region of Criozevan. Harsh desert with dry plains, jagged cliffs, and scorched canyons.
- Includes underground towns, ancient crypts, and limited coastal access. Formerly warmer, now dry and wind-blasted.

#### **GOVERNMENT — THE DUNE ACCORD**

- A unique governing system born from the civil war. Named after the survival pact signed at the site where Fire District Leader Vulkran erupted in death — melting a canyon into Ashglass Hall.
- Ashglass Hall: Made of black obsidian and lava glass, glowing with heat veins and scorched stone. Council debates happen beneath molten-stone pillars and hanging lava-stained stalactites. Ashglass Hall itself is a physical reminder of past destruction and the cost of disunity.
- Four High Seats: Each representing a former district (Bug, Magic, Death, Fire). Elected by district population and surrounding towns. All four seats hold equal voting power.
- Voice of Sand: A fifth seat elected by the entire kingdom every five years. Holds power to break ties, pass emergency orders, and represent Fodon internationally. Known as 'the Will of the Wastes' — one who speaks not for a city, but for the land. Traditionally seen as a symbol of national unity beyond the fractured district lines.
- The Dune Accord governs all of Fodon, including remote desert outposts and crypt towns. It prioritizes balance between local power and central authority. The system emphasizes pragmatic leadership, war memory, and shared survival in a brutal land.

#### **HISTORICAL CONFLICTS**

- **The War of Fodon (820–847 ACC):** A prolonged internal civil conflict between the kingdom's four districts — Bug, Magic, Death, and Fire. Underlying cause: the rapid spread of the Tharnex (Bug District) across all four districts triggered severe persecution and demonization by other factions. Tharnex were killed in large numbers during the war. Vorvax rose to power mid-conflict as the Tharnex protector and fortified the Bug District. The war ended in 847 when an individual later known as Lucifer (#6 Arashi) assassinated all four district leaders simultaneously to prove his worth to Arashi leadership. See: The War of Fodon (History).
- **The Ipadora Land War (c. 900 ACC):** After Ipadora completed its eastern expansion to the Frada river border, it began taxing Fodon aggressively for water and land access. When a criminal in Ipadora territory killed a Fodon Bug District Tharnex, Fodon interpreted it as deliberate aggression and declared war. In coalition with Frada, Fodon drove Ipadora off the mainland, seizing former Ipadora territory. The manmade river dividing the two is a permanent monument to the conflict. See: The Ipadora Land War (History).

## **State of Akison**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Akison (Island Capital): A city that encompasses its entire island. Built like a five-petaled cherry blossom expanding outward from the central palace. Inspired by ancient Japanese cities — curved rooftops, zen courtyards, fortified bamboo walls, stone walkways over water. Trade and travel hub to other continents. Friendly to outsiders. Known for its martial government, rogue tech zones, and world trade access.

- The Five Blossom Rings (Sakura-go):
  - Tetsukaku (鉄閣, 'Iron Heights'): Central petal and government district. Home to the Iron Bloom (Sunlee's palace and the Tetsugan meeting hall). Lined with stone watchtowers, ritual gardens, and elevated ceremonial halls.
  - Koganemura (黄金村, 'Golden Village'): Martial training petal — temples, dojos, and tournament grounds. Monks, swordsmen, and Iron Path initiates live and train here. Hosts annual martial festivals and public spar duels.
  - Uramizu (裏水, 'Hidden Waters'): Subterranean and canal-filled black market zone and criminal underbelly. Curved alleys, shadow bridges, and hidden gates form a maze under the surface. Policed unofficially by old guilds and smugglers who answer to no one but tradition.
  - Harashima (原島, 'Sprawling Isle'): Riverfront petal — Akison's economic lifeline and port district. Houses foreign embassies, trader towers, and floating market barges. Known for its cranes, sails, and midnight auctions.
  - Shōmeika (照明花, 'Luminous Blossom'): Cultural and spiritual heart of the city — where art, music, and religion converge. Filled with blossom-viewing temples, ink halls, and ancestral gardens. Night is lit by paper lanterns, spirit drums, and performance arenas.

- Kurashiki Region (Northern Island Mountains): Located in the cherry blossom-lined peaks of Akison's island. Known for its cold mists, sparse mountaintop settlements, and ancient dueling sites. Home to powerful samurai and shinobi clans, each guarding unique traditions and secrets. Difficult to navigate — most outsiders are watched or rejected unless sponsored by a clan. Governed through clan law, but all swear conditional loyalty to the Iron Path.

- Kurashiki Lords: Ancient bloodlines rooted in mountaintop keeps and cherry blossom valleys. Each clan controls schools, shrines, and assassin orders unique to their house. Some clans train warriors for the Blades of the Iron Path in exchange for influence.

- Oniofast (Mainland): Jungle town built into ancient shifting ruins. HQ for covert Pegasus operations. Streets are half-mechanical, half-organic. Constantly shifting. Rose, Butterfly, and magis are banned by silent agreement — entry is suicide. Known for its annual 'Signal Harvest,' when rogue tech is extracted from the jungle. Locals trained in survival, stealth, and encryption.

- Kusamori (Mainland): Center of medicine, poison, and herbs. Built on platforms above the forest canopy. People travel by tram-type vehicles. Extends across the whole peninsula.

- Okbridge (Mainland): Checkpoint city connecting the mainland to Akison island. Tight customs, engineer guilds, and vehicle refit stations. Strategic for defense, trade, and secret smuggling. Built around a huge bridge from Akison to Okbridge. Vehicular repair capital.

- Neruvalis (Mainland): The 'Disappearing City' — built on a slope into the water, sometimes submerged by tides. Midway port to Glaril. Underwater tech salvage point.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Split between a dense jungle mainland (wild jungles, brackish rivers, towering canopies, and hidden labs) and a mountain-and-blossom island (political and cultural heart of the kingdom).

#### **NOTABLE HISTORY**

- **Origin:** The State of Akison was formerly the **Republic of Shimaguni**, one of the continent's older political entities. During the Golden War (795 ACC), Shimaguni backed the South Goldhelm revolutionaries. When the war ended in the south's defeat, Sunlee — who had fought in the conflict and was respected by the population for his attempt to stop it — was elected head of state. He renamed the republic the State of Akison and established it under the Iron Path doctrine. See: The Golden War (History).

#### **GOVERNMENT — THE IRON PATH**

- Ruled by Sunlee, the Master of Martial Arts — one of the most powerful beings in the world.
- Governs through personal strength, respect, and the doctrine of discipline and clarity.
- The Tetsugan ('Iron Eye Council'): 4 Kurashiki Clan Emissaries, 5 City Keepers (one from each of the five Sakura-go districts: Tetsukaku, Koganemura, Uramizu, Harashima, Shōmeika), and 2 Tora no Shūjin ('Prison Tigers' — Sunlee's appointed field enforcers). The council meets within the Iron Bloom, a fortress directly in the center of the city, resembling a Japanese temple, guarded by invisible shinobi in every shadow of the building. Votes are held only when Sunlee allows — his silence overrides any tie.

#### **MILITARY — BLADES OF THE IRON PATH**

- Akison's elite force, personally trained or approved by Sunlee. Organized into four primary martial orders:
  - Tetsu-no-Kiba ('Iron Fangs'): Frontal combatants and urban enforcers.
  - Yamigasa ('Shadow Hats'): Ninja operatives trained in Kurashiki. Masters of silence.
  - Kinzoku Kawa ('Metal River'): Amphibious soldiers and river guardians.
  - Sōryū Heika ('Twin Dragon Guards'): Sunlee's personal protectors, feared by Arashi-level foes.
- Entry requires surviving the Tetsudōmei ('Iron Oath') — a week-long silent jungle trial of survival, pain, and willpower.

## **Republic of Frada**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Frada (Capital): Administrative and command core of the republic. Built around the Glass Bastion citadel (a transparent dome of reinforced crystal that reflects spells and projectiles). Grid-like road layout for strategic movement and quick lockdowns. Factories, barracks, and research hubs form concentric layers around the central command tower. Civilians live in standardized housing zones under curfews and sector codes. Large central plaza used for military parades, oath ceremonies, and execution drills. Diverse but weak government. Medium crime. Doesn't prioritize outsiders.

- Hiypolis (Military City): One of the most fortified cities in Eldunary. Houses the Fradan War College, Republic Armory, and Holo-Tech Forge Docks. Divided into training zones, living blocks, and the Foundry Belt (a district of tech labs and gear manufactories). Built along a riverbank between the sea and a shielded inland base. In wartime, the entire city can transform into a mobile supply fortress via rail barge and sky towers. Closest non-desert city to Ipadora Sanctuary. Direct connection to Ipadora Kingdom. Produces custom holo-tech weaponry for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Dominated by dry plains, wind-cut ridges, and wide strategic rivers. Largely flat — military outposts easily redeployed via rail or hover convoys.
- Borders the sea with key access to international shipping lanes.
- Riverbanks are used for both training fields and logistics stations.

#### **GOVERNMENT — THE BRONZE CHAIN**

- Frada is governed by The Bronze Chain — a dual body government rooted in military merit.
- The Senate (26 members): Elected by citizen-vote from each province or army division. Debates economic laws, foreign alliances, and resource allotment. Every senator must serve at least 5 years in the armed forces before eligibility.
- The Command Council (9 generals): Active military officers elected by senior war veterans. Handles defense policy, emergency declarations, and war tech contracts.
- Final decisions require both sides. If martial law is declared, the Command Council rules unilaterally.

#### **MILITARY**

- Universal military service — every citizen must serve at least 3 years. Motto: 'Strength is the Spine of State.'
- Shield Corps: Heavy infantry — holo-shield formations and breach tactics.
- Striker Units: Elite recon and assault — adaptive holo-stealth systems.
- Sky Darts: Air division — hover-tech, drop deployment, scout gliders.
- Black Cloaks: Internal watchdogs and border enforcers trained in suppression and purge. Hunt deserters ('Broken Links') until eliminated.
- Forge Guard: Tech-specialists — holo-tech weapons, AI-linked armor, mech support.
- Known for their discipline, tactical coordination, and zero tolerance for desertion.

#### **ECONOMY & TRADE**

- Holo-tech weapons are Frada's primary national export — ranging from energy blades to battlefield vision suites. Produces custom holo-tech for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

#### **CULTURE & SOCIETY**

- Praises utility, loyalty, and sacrifice. Civilian life revolves around work assignments, fitness tests, and loyalty rituals. Art and religion are seen as optional luxuries, often reserved for retired veterans or high-ranking officers.
- Annual 'March of Flame' commemorates the invention of holotech.
- National motto inscribed at every city gate: 'Fall in Line. Or Fall.'

#### **NOTABLE INFRASTRUCTURE**

- The Glass Bastion: Transparent dome of reinforced crystal surrounding the Senate; reflects incoming spells or projectiles.
- The Foundry Belt: Industrial district where holo-tech blueprints are updated daily and combat suits are pressure-forged.
- The Spine Track: Super-long stone pathway between Frada and Hiypolis, used for honor marches, war games, and public exile.

#### **FOUNDING HISTORY *(715 ACC)***

The Azure Paladin — born in **692 ACC** in the Kingdom of Vacron — was one of the great peacemakers of his era. In **715 ACC** he founded the Republic of Frada, establishing it as a disciplined civic-military state built on order and law. In **730 ACC** he conquered the independent territory of **Eshar-Thi** (*eshar* — erasure; *thi* — form: a union nation whose architecture and philosophy centered on the extensive use of mirrored surfaces to dissolve the boundaries of visible form), absorbing it into Frada's borders and bringing the republic to its current size.

In **732 ACC**, during a diplomatic meeting in Criozevan, Fluffy appeared and gifted him a magical item. The Azure Paladin became the second being in history to interact with Fluffy directly. The exact nature of the gift is not publicly recorded.

Following a series of personal losses and disillusionment with what he saw as the fundamental corruption of civic order — institutions he had built being used by others in ways he never intended — the Azure Paladin turned to dark magic. He studied it obsessively and was fundamentally altered by it. He stopped aging from the moment he fully embraced it. He is now known as the **Dark Paladin** and holds rank **#1 of the Arashi** — not by internal loyalty but by sheer combat power, an acknowledgment even the Arashi cannot ignore. He has not held any formal role in Frada's government for centuries. The republic evolved into its current Senate structure without him. See: Arashi Members.

## **Kingdom of Iyhago**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Iyhago Prime (Island Capital): A spiraling sanctuary where each district represents an aspect of the Quiet Harmonic. The highest point houses the Sanctum Spiral where the ruler resides. Access requires ritual purification and a silence oath. Located on the southern island called Vehalo, accessible by three sacred bridges. Port city and sea trade hub. Friendly to outsiders.

- Uyrand: Plains town known for memory archives and mirrored halls inside towering, skyscraper-like buildings. Rose HQ (see: Organizations). Nothing otherwise special.
- Andport: The primary western gate — crossed only after ritual oath-walking. Southwestern port town. Bridge connecting to the Republic of Frada. Controls goods passing from northwest to south.
- Ubraamore: Bridge and checkpoint city into Iyhago's island. Crimson Rooks outpost. Secretly the black market tech trade capital.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Mainland of terraced hills, rivers, and elevated cities aligned by spiritual principles.
- Movement and city design follow spiritual symmetry — every route has meaning.

#### **GOVERNMENT & RELIGION — THE QUIET HARMONIC**

- A religious theocracy. Life is structured around silence, memory, and sacred speech. Bridges, reflection, and ritual geometry guide architecture and law.
- Worship centers on stillness, reflection, and the belief that balance creates divinity. Prayer involves movement and posture — speech is rare and sacred.
- Public rituals are silent. Sacred texts are visual, revealed through mirrored surfaces.
- Children learn silence and posture before they learn language. Unauthorized use of sacred speech is a serious offense. Festivals are wordless light-processions. Laws are echoed by chime bells, not voices.

#### **NOTABLE HISTORY**

- **Pre-Kingdom History — The Vehalo Territories:** Before the Kingdom of Iyhago existed, the southern island of Vehalo was home to two independent settlements — collectively called the **Vehalo Territories** — connected by the same spiritual tradition that would later define the Quiet Harmonic. The territories were not unified under any central authority; they cooperated on ritual and trade but maintained separate governance. Veles himself was born in one of these settlements, establishing his deep roots in the land long before any kingdom was formally constituted.

- **Founding (Post-Golden War, 795 ACC):** Veles was already a widely respected figure on the continent before the Golden War. After the Equinox of Power concluded the war, the people of the Vehalo Territories voted him to leadership — a mandate he had not sought. He accepted. The two settlements were unified under his direction, and the city of Iyhago Prime was built as a new capital expressing Quiet Harmonic principles in its architecture and layout. Veles then expanded the kingdom's territory steadily over the following decades through diplomatic incorporation, not conquest. See: The Golden War (History).

- **Absorption of Eshar-Thi:** Eshar-Thi (*eshar* — erasure; *thi* — form) was a small union nation whose culture centered on mirrored surfaces and the philosophical dissolution of fixed form. Originally conquered by the Republic of Frada in 730 ACC, it was later absorbed into the Kingdom of Iyhago through negotiated transfer after the Azure Paladin's departure from Frada. The territory is now governed as a standard Iyhago province under Quiet Harmonic law.

#### **RULER — VELES, MASTER OF MAGIC**

- Speaks only through harmonic pulses interpreted by chosen attendants. Believed to commune directly with the divine pattern guiding the kingdom.

#### **MILITARY — THE RESONANT GUARD**

- Elite force of Spellers trained in sacred speech-based magic called Kōtoba.
- Words are weapons — a single syllable can reshape memory, space, or structure.
- Guards spend years in silence before casting their first phrase.
- Ranks: Initiates (The Voiceless) → Active field casters → High-commanders (speak only once per cycle).

#### **LANGUAGE — SHAYATHI**

- Sacred language used in worship, law, and magical casting. Built on tone, breath, posture, and silence as much as vocabulary.
- Key terms: sha (balance), thi (form), vala (voice), yunai (silence), eshar (erasure).
- Kōtoba is a refined form of Shayathi used only by the Resonant Guard. Unauthorized use of advanced Shayathi is forbidden and spiritually dangerous.

## **Republic of Oredsy**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Oredsy (Capital, citizen name: Tharnselda — 'Sword's Choice'): Built around the central arena Fereltharn ('Justice's Blade'), used for duels, referendums, and civic votes. The Tower of Vaelrin houses the Circle Council and archives of national law. Run by Pegasus (see: Organizations). Southern land trade hub. Kind of friendly to outsiders.

- Wrofast: Port town controlling the river-to-sea choke point. Creates ships and innovative maritime tech. All ships bear a metallic blue 'W' on the top-right of each sail and the bowsprit tip. Population speaks Sailor Speak, a separate language.
- Imuton: Forest town surrounded by grand trees. People live inside enormous tree trunks.
- Icogas: Ancient magic site under the town square. Magic is unstable inside town — rumored to be cursed. Holotech and runestones do not function here. Secret Butterfly monitoring station.
- Zhuiburn: Surrounded by perpetual flames. Extremely unfriendly to outsiders (rumors of being burned alive on entry). Population speaks Pyrrhith.

#### **NOTABLE HISTORY**

- **Founding:** The Republic of Oredsy did not exist as a unified state before the Golden War (795 ACC). The territory was a collection of small, independent entities. After the Equinox of Power concluded the war, Selvarin — the Master of Swords, who had fought on the north Goldhelm side — united these smaller territories under the flag of the town of Oredsy and established the Republic. He has governed it ever since. See: The Golden War (History).

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**
- Cities built in ring formations around central training yards or debate plazas.
- Trade roads guarded by rotating citizen patrols called Bladewards.

#### **GOVERNMENT — THE FREE ASSEMBLY**

- Made up of elected delegates from each region, chosen through open vote or challenge.
- Two bodies: The Circle (high mentors, former champions, senior arbiters of law) and The Commons (rotating citizen delegates serving fixed terms).
- Major decisions may be overturned by popular duel or collective voice-vote in Tharnic.

#### **LEADER — SELVARIN, MASTER OF SWORDS**

- Holds the lifelong title of Master of Swords and elected Voice of the Republic. Known as Kirel'dra Tharnic ('Speaker of the Sword's Truth').
- Embodies the civic virtues of clarity, strength, and fairness.
- Mediates national disputes, leads the militia in wartime, sets training standards.

#### **MILITARY — THE BLADEGUARD**

- A trained citizen militia with martial schools in every city. Voluntary but expected — every adult citizen trained by age 14.
- Road Wards: Mounted defenders and scouts.
- Honor Guard: Elite duelists and civic protectors.
- Steel Chorus: Battlefield signalers trained in rhythm-based Tharnic calls.
- Officers voted in by their units through ritual declaration.

#### **CULTURE & SOCIETY**

- Swordcraft is a foundational discipline tied to moral philosophy and civic law.
- All major disputes — property, leadership, even marriages — may be resolved by formal duel.
- Public debates held in Rings of Word and Will — rhetoric and restraint carry equal weight with steel.
- Festivals feature oath-readings, retellings of ancient duels, and open competitions.
- Foundational principles: 'Speak with clarity. Fight with purpose. Live with honor.'
- The Republic exists not to rule its people, but to be shaped by their skill, their speech, and their sword.

#### **ECONOMY & TRADE**

- Exports masterwork blades, armour, and steel. Markets operate under civic guild charters ratified by the Free Assembly.
- Contracts signed in both Common and formal Tharnic. Known for its binding contracts.

#### **LANGUAGE — THARNIC**

- Sacred civic language of Oredsy. Built for clarity, strength, and moral alignment. Used in courts, military orders, and oaths. Spoken with firm tone and minimal ambiguity.
- Key terms: dael (honor/truth), loen (dishonor/challenge), tharn (sword/path/will), kirel (speak/declare), selda (choice/vote), ferel (law/justice).
- Sample phrases: 'Vaela selda dael.' (Freedom is the choice of the honorable.) | 'Kirel tharn loen.' (You declare the blade without honor.) | 'Morin vaela.' (Remember liberty.)
- Children learn Tharnic alongside sword forms.

## **Ipadora Kingdom**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Ipadora Sanctuary (Capital): Located on the western side of the Ipadora island. A true sanctuary — almost no crime. Welcomes outsiders, refugees, and peaceful travelers. Has both a surface island city and a vast underwater complex. The Ipadora Palace lies beneath the island in a heavily secured cavern. Entire capital is heavily patrolled, especially underwater.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Kingdom is mostly underwater — built in deep oceanic valleys.
- Surface terrain includes beachfronts and lightly forested areas.
- A large manmade river separates its mainland portion from rival kingdoms.
- Underwater landscapes filled with coral structures, bioluminescent flora, and fortified trenches.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- In ancient times, Ipadora controlled much more mainland territory. Lost land after a massive war against the Kingdoms of Fodon and Frada.
- After being driven back, Ipadora cut a river to physically and symbolically separate from its former enemies.
- Despite the loss, Ipadora maintains autonomy and military power through water control.

#### **STRATEGIC POWER**

- Controls all major rivers, sea lanes, and underwater trade routes across Criozevan.
- All kingdoms using waterways must pay taxes or gain permission from Ipadora — a monopoly that makes the kingdom economically and politically powerful.

### **Kingdom of Vacron — Towns**

- **Clocester:** Former mining colony. Crystal caverns and unstable ground (frequent collapses). Tunnel access to KoF, RoF, and KoI borders. Mixed population of refugees and runaways. Home to a neutral forge with Rose protection. Criminal meeting ground. Central spot between Vacron, Sloumont, and Hiypolis. Town militia uses salvaged war-tech.
- **Klanron:** Peninsula between two rivers. Butterfly HQ. Meeting point for all Magic Societies. 90% magic-user population. Friendly to visitors — changes when non-magis try to stay.
- **Anehull:** Ghost town rebuilt into a resort. Former Arashi campaign battleground. Rose leaders use it for covert meetings. Locals profit from war relic tourism. Under constant Crimson Rooks watch. Magic dampeners active at all times. Rumors of hell malefici sightings.

### **State of Akison — Towns**

- **Oniofast (Mainland):** Jungle town built into ancient overgrown ruins. Pegasus covert operations HQ. Half-mechanical, half-organic streets. Rose, Butterfly, and magis banned — entry is suicide. Annual 'Signal Harvest' event when rogue tech is extracted from the jungle. Locals trained in survival, stealth, and encryption.
- **Kusamori (Mainland):** Center of medicine, poison, and herbs. Built on platforms above the forest canopy. Tram-type transportation. Extends across the whole peninsula.

### **Nikolem Kingdom — Towns**

- **Cridbury:** Built into the foothills of the Jagged Mountains. Home to many Golems and miners. Famous for strong metal and rare minerals. Training center for heavy weapon users. Outsiders without a guide often get 'lost' in the tunnels.
- **Klosdon:** Forest rest stop in the middle of Nikolem. Golems live peacefully. Few visitors, fewer rules. Known for strange glowing plants at night.
- **Phaaross:** Bridge city into Vacron. Strong Golem military presence. Stone wall facing Vacron. Watchtowers on all sides. Trade hub from northwest to northeast.

### **Warring Darkmane Realm — Towns**

- **Vlurg:** Town centered around its market. Black market capital. Dark elf population speaks Nualthyr when not wanting to be understood.
- **Wrediff:** Hidden training ground for dark elf warriors. Shielded by dark elf magic — rarely found by outsiders. No markets or trade — only forges, shrines, and poison-makers. Locals speak only Nualthyr.
- **Adlens:** Diverse, peaceful town. Home to dark elves who reject violence, Golems who defected from the Golem King, and Goldhelms who fled corruption. Large port. Trade hub from GK to southeast by boat. Peace treaty signed here. Many rules enforced regularly by the Aces, hired by the local government.

### **Goldhelm Kingdom — Towns**

- **Ibeson:** Scientific capital of Criozevan. Many public and private labs. Secret underground Goldhelm experimentation.

### **Independent / City-States**

- **Glaril:** The biggest underwater city. Largest concentration of fish-types anywhere. Connected to Neruvalis. Hub for underwater technology. Frequent pirate activity. Not under full governance of the State of Akison — governed by a faction of the Ipadora family. Deep ties to Ipadora family.
- **Skellmoor:** A floating steampunk city suspended in the cloud layer above the continent. Permanently cloaked in cloud cover — invisible from ground level and from the air unless you know its altitude band. Accessed by vertical craft, specific sky-corridors, or black market transit contacts. No laws. No governing body. No citizenship requirements. Criminals, outcasts, unlicensed engineers, and fugitives coexist under an unspoken social contract: don't start what you can't finish. The economy runs on the technology black market — unlicensed gadgetry, prototype weapons, stolen blueprints, and experimental curiosities that would be confiscated or banned anywhere with a functioning government. The Crimson Rooks cannot reach it. Jurisdiction does not extend to altitude. This is the point. Population is transient by design — few people live there permanently; most pass through to buy, sell, trade, or disappear.

  *Crimson Rooks maintains ongoing surveillance of known access corridors but has never successfully conducted an operation within the city itself.*

# **VI.  Character Power Rank**

The strongest known beings in Eldunary, ranked from most powerful to least. The Masters all share a roughly equal power level at rank 5.

**Note:** This ranking reflects demonstrated or perceived threat level, not raw power. The Golem King (#4) is believed to possess power equal to Fluffy (#1) but is ranked lower because he chooses never to use his full abilities. He has no desire to be the strongest or to control territory beyond Nikolem.

| Rank | Name | Notes |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Fluffy** | Meta (transcendent) — omnipotent magical authority. The god of all magic users. Wears the Fleece, which stores thousands of enchanted items. Has been publicly sighted only 5 times in 1,000 years. Never intervenes in conflicts. See: Major Characters. |
| **2** | **Crimson Knight** | Folkwynd — born in Vacron. Founder of the Crimson Rooks. Wields the indestructible Crimson Blazer (gift from Fluffy) and the Crimson Greatsword (steel gifted by the Golem King). No magic — pure combat mastery and legendary charisma. See: Major Characters. |
| **3** | **Zunarorth** | Dragon — the last surviving dragon from the Dragon Era. Has not been reliably seen in hundreds of years. Sightings reported roughly every 100 years. Survived the extinction event caused by The Shadow. See: Major Characters. |
| **4** | **Golem King** | Primordial entity — 100 ft tall, covered in thousands of runes. Creator of all Golems. Believed to be equal in power to Fluffy but never uses his full abilities. Has not been publicly seen since the Crimson Convergence. Mentor to the Crimson Knight. See: Major Characters. |
| **5** | **The Masters** | Three beings of near-equal power: Sunlee (Martial Arts), Selvarin (Swords), Veles (Magic). Fought to a stalemate in the First Great War — the Equinox of Power. |

# **VII.  Magi Types**

Magic users in Eldunary fall into four main categories. Many powerful sorcerers (such as Merlin) place their runestone jewel inside a staff or ring.

### **Metas**

- People born with a specific innate power — e.g., talking to animals, super strength.
- Population: 27.5% of all Magi.

### **Malefici**

- Scarlets: Magic users whose powers can run out of control. (1% of Malefici / 0.275% of all Magi)
- Dark Malefici (49.5% of Malefici / ~13.6% of all Magi):
  - **Hell Magic** — Used to spawn demons and creatures from hell. (2% of Dark Malefici). **Hell is a confirmed separate dimension** — not a metaphor or a religious concept but a documented other-realm with its own entities. Hell Malefici are individuals who have formed a pact with a hell-entity, granting them access to hell's creatures and power in exchange for terms only the individual and the entity know. **Berserk** (#2 Arashi) made such a pact — the specific terms of his deal are unknown, but the power it granted transformed him into one of the most physically dangerous beings on the continent. Hell malefici sightings are extremely rare outside of established pact-holders; unconfirmed sightings in **Anehull** (Kingdom of Vacron) have been reported and remain under ongoing Crimson Rooks investigation. Whether these represent additional pact-holders, exiled hell entities, or misidentified magic users is not yet established.
  - **Pure Dark Magic** — Can bring people back from the dead or possess others. (98% of Dark Malefici)
- Mage: Can cast any spell or enchantment. (49.5% of Malefici / ~13.6% of all Magi)

### **Runestones**

- People who can only control their power through a runestone, weapon, or item.
- Population: 45% of all Magi — the most common type.

### **Devourers**

- An extraordinarily rare hereditary classification. Devourers do not cast, channel, or store magic — they absorb it from living sources passively and involuntarily. No known Magi classification system in use on Criozevan currently contains this category; scholars who have encountered evidence of it have historically misattributed the effects to illness, curse, or unusual environmental conditions.
- **Mechanism:** The Devourer ability operates constantly and without conscious activation. Magic users within proximity of a Devourer find their reserves slowly depleting. The stronger the Devourer's emotional state, the larger the radius and the faster the rate of absorption. At full emotional extremity, a Devourer can strip a magic user's power entirely — temporarily or, in severe cases, permanently.
- **Passive vs. Active:** In its passive form the drain is gradual and imperceptible to both parties. In its active form — triggered only by extreme emotion, never by will — it is acute and potentially catastrophic. No known Devourer has ever consciously controlled the active form. Learning to release absorbed energy consciously, rather than holding it indefinitely, is considered the central challenge of the classification.
- **The Release:** Absorbed magical energy does not remain inert. A Devourer who has accumulated significant reserves and releases them — voluntarily or involuntarily — produces a discharge of raw undifferentiated magical energy. This manifests as a shockwave affecting all magic users in the area simultaneously: weaker mages are overwhelmed; stronger ones experience a violent surge. The release does not target. It radiates. In the hours following a major release, the Devourer absorbs faster and more desperately than normal — a temporary void state that is dangerous to any magic user nearby. The carrier typically experiences this as an unusual calm, making it one of the most dangerous periods.
- **Interaction with Corrupted Magic:** Devourer energy and corrupted magical energy are fundamentally opposed. Corrupted runes in the presence of a Devourer become unstable and recoil — their dark energy destabilized by contact with the absorption field. This effect is involuntary and occurs even when the Devourer is unaware of the runes' presence.
- **The Goldhelm Bloodline:** The only confirmed Devourer bloodline in recorded history is the Goldhelm royal line. The ability has diluted significantly over a thousand years of non-use — most modern Goldhelm royals carry only trace amounts insufficient to cause observable effects. The current generation has produced one individual in whom the full ancestral power has re-expressed: Princess Seraphina. The reason for this re-expression is unknown.
- **Historical Classification:** The oldest known reference to Devourers appears in a pre-Convergence Folkwynd oral tradition fragment, preserved in a single damaged text held in the Klanron archive. The fragment uses a word that translates roughly as *the hungry ones* or, in more poetic rendering, *those who remember what the world was before magic had a shape.* No Magi scholar in the current era has connected this fragment to the Goldhelm bloodline.
- **Population:** Effectively one known active carrier in the current era (Seraphina). The classification does not appear in any modern Magi taxonomy.

### **Distribution Summary**

| Type | % of All Magi | Notes |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| Metas | **27.5%** | Born with innate ability |
| Malefici (total) | **27.5%** | Split into Scarlets, Dark Malefici, and Mages |
|   — Scarlets | **0.275%** | Uncontrolled power |
|   — Hell Dark Malefici | **0.27%** | Demon summoning |
|   — Pure Dark Malefici | **13.3%** | Resurrection / possession |
|   — Mage | **13.6%** | Full spell casting |
| Runestones | **45%** | Item-bound control |
| Devourers | **< 0.001%** | Hereditary absorption — not present in any current Magi taxonomy. One known active carrier. |

# **VIII.  Arashi Members**

The Arashi are a powerful criminal organization with hidden underlying goals. Members are ranked #0 through #12. Member #0 is currently under investigation and their identity is unknown.

**#0  Unknown**

| Power | Unknown |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Unknown |
| **Location** | Unknown |
| **Backstory** | Currently under investigation. Identity and motives are classified. |

**#1  Dark Paladin**  —  *The Dark Avenger*

| Power | Black Magic |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Folkwynd |
| **Also Known As** | The Azure Paladin (former identity) |
| **Arashi Trait** | Domain: Dark Sanctuary |
| **Location** | Icogas |
| **Backstory** | Born in **692 ACC** in the Kingdom of Vacron. As the **Azure Paladin**, he was one of the great civic-minded warriors of his era — a visionary who founded the **Crimson Rooks** in **712 ACC** as a peacekeeping force, then founded the **Republic of Frada** in **715 ACC** as a civic-military state built on law and order. In **730 ACC** he conquered the independent territory of Eshar-Thi, absorbing it into Frada. In **732 ACC**, Fluffy appeared to him and gifted him a magical item — the second person in history confirmed to have interacted with Fluffy directly. Following personal loss and disillusionment with the corruption of the institutions he had built, he turned to dark magic. He was permanently altered by it and stopped aging from the moment he fully embraced it. He became the Dark Paladin. He no longer holds any role in Frada. He is ranked **#1 of the Arashi** not because of his loyalty to the organization but because no one currently alive in Criozevan is his equal in combat. The Arashi acknowledges this by position regardless of political dynamics. |

**#2  Berserk**  —  *The Devil's Advocate*

| Power | Super Strength and a giant sword |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Deal With the Devil |
| **Location** | Oniofast |
| **Backstory** | A savage warrior who made a pact with the devil to become stronger. |

**#3  Nebbio**  —  *The Assassin of the Mist*

| Power | Mist manipulation, sharp throwable poison-infused needles |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Folkwynd |
| **Arashi Trait** | Domain: Mist Nebula |
| **Location** | Suudon |
| **Backstory** | Born into **the Mist family** — a Folkwynd noble line who served as Wrofast's de facto ruling family, built on an assassination tradition where internal succession was resolved through strength and weakness was not tolerated. Nebbio was rejected during childhood as too weak to carry the family name. He left Wrofast under humiliation, a departure the family treated as non-existence. He spent years becoming stronger. In **993 ACC**, he returned. He assassinated his father — the family head — first, then killed every remaining member of the household. He left Wrofast ungoverned and abandoned, claiming no title or territory. He is now ranked **#3 of the Arashi**. See: The Mist Family Massacre (History). |

**#4  Rabuka**  —  *Demon Shark*

| Power | Large sword (water element) and a katana (lightning element) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Great Blue Chasm |
| **Location** | Glaril |
| **Appearance** | Rabuka's massive frame is covered in intricate battle tattoos — each one a record of past victories and conquered foes. The tattoos, combined with deep scars etched into his flesh, serve as a visual testament to his violent history and his resilience. |
| **Backstory** | Born in Glaril, an underwater city off the coast of Akison. Left on the streets and became a bloodthirsty killer. Learned swordsmanship and magic through unknown means. Has killed over 1,000 people. Arrested by the Crimson Rooks multiple times. |

**#5  Velho**  —  *The Abyssal Monarch*

| Power | Necromancy |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Folkwynd |
| **Arashi Trait** | Domain: Heaven's Chains |
| **Location** | Unknown |
| **Backstory** | Served as **Master of Magic** from approximately **846 ACC** until his death in **889 ACC** — one of the longest tenures of any Master. An incredibly powerful magic-user with an obsession with heaven and the afterlife, Velho was also one of the rare institutional authorities trusted by both sides during the **Wizard Uprising** (c. 880–890 ACC). He spent years negotiating with revolutionary Malefici leaders and in 889 ACC offered personal compromises to over one hundred of them in a direct attempt to end the conflict. He was killed. His death fractured the revolutionary coalition and accelerated the Uprising's collapse within two years. Whether he resurrected himself or was resurrected by another is unknown. He appeared among the founding members of the Arashi and now holds rank **#5**. See: The Wizard Uprising (History). |

**#6  Lucifer**

| Power | Magic Cancellation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Instant Shutdown |
| **Location** | Zhuiburn (born) |
| **Backstory** | Created a new type of magic called 'Magic Cancellation' — temporarily extracts a target's magic and transfers it to himself while rendering the target's magic useless for a period. Killed all four district leaders of Fodon. |

**#7  Biruda**  —  *The Cybernetic Oni*

| Power | Engineering; wields a war hammer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Domain: Junkyard |
| **Location** | Akison |
| **Appearance** | Biruda's face is a terrifying fusion of metal and flesh. His mechanical eyes glow with an eerie red light, giving him an unsettling, inhuman gaze. His cybernetic limbs emit faint whirring sounds when he moves. The overall effect is one of cold, calculated menace — a being that has deliberately replaced his own humanity with engineered precision. |
| **Backstory** | Born on Akison and learned the way of the Oni Samurai. An outcast as a child, he left to learn forging and engineering. Upgraded himself by attaching parts of his metallic creations directly to his body. |

**#8  Oto**

| Power | Sound manipulation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Audio Overload |

**#9  Kaboom**

| Power | Explosion |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Nuke |
| **Location** | Ibeson (created) |
| **Backstory** | Created by the Goldhelm government in Ibeson as a destructive weapon. Escaped the facility and found Arashi members, who recognized his potential and recruited him. |

**#10  Ryobik**

| Power | Robot / mechanical intelligence |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Analysis |

**#11  Spector**

| Power | Mirror manipulation (amplified) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Realm Expansion: Hall of Mirrors |
| **Location** | Andport (born) |
| **Backstory** | Born in Andport. As an infant, his family was attacked by a hell malefici. During the attack, he was thrown into a mirror and impaled from all sides. The only way to save him was to fuse the mirror shards into his body, combining it with his innate meta power of teleportation. Now uses his amplified mirror powers to teleport Arashi members to their assignment locations. |

**#12  Helm**

| Power | Poison manipulation (gas and gloop forms) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Arashi Trait** | Death Eye: Hydra Oil |
| **Location** | Ibeson |
| **Backstory** | A scientist at a large potion and pharmaceutical company. Had a mental disorder and could not speak. In an accident, two different chemicals spilled on him — burning his arms and fusing two poison globs into them (gas form and gloop form). |

# **IX.  Families of Power**

The most influential noble and ruling families in Eldunary.

### **Ipadora Family — House Nereval**

- Location: Ipadora Sanctuary
- Formal house name: **House Nereval**. Rules the Ipadora Kingdom.
- Matriarchal succession — the eldest daughter of the ruling line inherits leadership. If no daughter exists, succession passes to the closest female-line relative. Male succession is recognized only in extraordinary circumstances and requires a full council vote.
- A faction of the Ipadora family also governs Glaril, the largest underwater city.
- **House Abyrath** is a cadet branch of House Nereval, established in 996 ACC to govern Glaril with formal autonomy. Its relationship to the main Nereval line is cooperative rather than subordinate.
- Notable Figures: Queen Nayele of the Tide (main line) • Prince Vaelen (head of House Abyrath, governor of Glaril)

### **House Abyrath** *(Cadet Branch of House Nereval)*

- Location: Glaril (largest underwater city, off the coast of Akison)
- Established **996 ACC** by Queen Nayele, who appointed her close advisor and kinsman Vaelen to govern Glaril with formal autonomy. The house takes its name from the old Ipadoran word for 'deep root.'
- Governs Glaril as a **representative democratic republic** — the only Ipadora-affiliated territory with this style of governance.
- Relationship to the main Nereval line: cooperative, not subordinate. House Abyrath is not required to seek approval from the Ipadora Sanctuary for internal decisions, though it coordinates on defense, trade, and external relations.
- Head: **Prince Vaelen** (see: Major Characters)

### **Darkmane Family**

- Location: Warring Darkmane Realm
- Once unified the dark elf realm under their rule over multiple generations. The family wielded control through both political authority and social fear — the Darkmane name carried enough weight to enforce loyalty without perpetual military enforcement.
- Notable Figure: Vaelith the Hollow.

**The Betrayal of Vaelith the Hollow (937 ACC):** Vaelith — a rising Darkmane family member — made a private arrangement with a Goldhelm government scientist working in Ibeson. He delivered his own brother Thalrith as a research subject in exchange for consideration that was never publicly specified. Thalrith's screams during the process were heard through Luthyrra — a sensitive Darkmane family member who had never before displayed strong magical response. The sound of her brother being tortured triggered the first recorded manifestation of a **Fallen** — a dark-magic-possessed husk state that transformed her permanently. She became known as **Luthyrra the Silent**. When the betrayal became known within the family, branches that had coexisted for decades turned against each other. Vaelith was removed from any formal position in 938 ACC. His fate afterward is not recorded. By 940 ACC, the Darkmane Realm had collapsed into the fractured warring state it remains today. The Fallen phenomenon — once thought impossible — has since recurred among Darkmane individuals during periods of extreme trauma.

### **Goldhelm Family**

- Location: Ovodon (Goldhelm Kingdom)
- The royal and only family of the Goldhelm race. All Goldhelms descend from this line.
- Head / King: Aldric (see: Major Characters)
- Princess: Seraphina (see: Major Characters)
- **The Devourer Bloodline:** The Goldhelm royal line carries a hereditary Devourer ability — the capacity to passively absorb magic from living sources. This ability was the true cause of the founding exodus from the Folkwynd, the establishment of the anti-magic ban, and the development of holotech. The ability has diluted across generations of non-use; most modern members of the line carry only trace amounts. Seraphina is the first full re-expression of the ability in centuries. No living member of the family knows this history. See: The Goldhelm Exodus (History) and Devourers (Magi Types).

# **X.  The Masters**

The Masters are the 5th most powerful beings in Eldunary. All three hold a roughly equal power level and govern their respective kingdoms. They fought one another during the First Great War (the Golden War, 795 ACC) in a climactic three-way engagement that ended in total stalemate. Upon witnessing the 500,000 dead around them, they chose peace. This battle is recorded in history as the Equinox of Power. The crater it left became the foundation for the city of Ibeson.

### **Master of Martial Arts — Sunlee**

- Leader of the State of Akison (formerly the Republic of Shimaguni). Was elected to lead the republic following the Golden War, which he had attempted to prevent before being drawn into it. Renamed the republic the State of Akison after taking power.
- Governs through the doctrine of the Iron Path — discipline, clarity, and personal strength.
- Never speaks more than necessary; his presence alone commands entire rooms.
- Said to have forged the Iron Path after defeating over a dozen crime kings and rebel clan lords with his bare hands.
- Carries only the Black Root — a metalwood staff from the old jungle. No armor, no magic.
- **Role in the Golden War:** Attempted to stop the conflict by traveling between factions. Failed. Eventually joined the fighting — not for either side, but against the premise that the war was acceptable. Fought both the north and south simultaneously before the three-way Equinox of Power stalemate ended everything.

### **Master of Swords — Selvarin**

- Leader of the Republic of Oredsy — a republic he personally founded by uniting smaller independent territories after the Golden War. Title: Kirel'dra Tharnic ('Speaker of the Sword's Truth').
- Embodies the civic virtues of clarity, strength, and fairness.
- Mediates disputes of national consequence, leads the militia in wartime, and sets training standards.
- **Role in the Golden War:** Joined the North Goldhelm side — not out of political conviction, but because the Goldhelm northern government was helping him forge a new sword. He honored that working relationship. After the Equinox of Power stalemate, he united the independent territories near Oredsy under a single government of his own design.

### **Master of Magic — Veles**

- Leader of the Kingdom of Iyhago — born there, and voted to the throne by his people after the Golden War. Has since expanded the kingdom's territory quietly to its current borders.
- Speaks only through harmonic pulses interpreted by chosen attendants.
- Believed to commune directly with the divine pattern guiding the Quiet Harmonic faith.
- **Role in the Golden War:** Joined the South Goldhelm revolutionaries because he genuinely believed their fight for greater freedom was a noble cause. Fought for the south with full conviction. After the Equinox of Power ended the war without resolution, he returned to Iyhago and was voted to leadership by the population that had long respected him.

### **Former Master of Magic — Velho**

- Held the title **Master of Magic** from approximately **846 ACC** until his death in **889 ACC** — one of the longest tenures of any Master on record.
- Was not a kingdom ruler — his authority was magical and institutional rather than territorial. He operated as an independent authority within the broader continental power structure, recognized by multiple kingdoms.
- Unlike the current Masters, Velho did not represent or govern a specific territory; his power derived from his standing within the magical hierarchy and his unmatched personal capabilities.
- During the **Wizard Uprising** (c. 880–890 ACC), he was the primary figure trusted by both institutional authorities and revolutionary Malefici as a potential neutral negotiator. His death in **889 ACC** — while offering personal compromises to over one hundred revolutionary leaders — collapsed the peace process and accelerated the Uprising's end.
- He was resurrected — by whom or how is unknown — and appeared among the founding members of the Arashi. He now holds rank **#5**. See: Arashi Members and The Wizard Uprising (History).

# **XI.  Organizations**

Major non-governmental and cross-kingdom organizations operating throughout Eldunary.

### **Pegasus**

- Founded in **Year 738** with the purpose of uniting the small, warring independent territories across Criozevan and establishing peace between them. The organization succeeded for approximately thirty years, maintaining a period of continental stability.
- The collapse was internal: as Pegasus shifted from active peacemaking to organizational maintenance, it required financial contributions from member nations. A faction of senior agents hijacked the leadership specifically to steal those funds. They held control for **six years** before member nations discovered the theft and withdrew en masse. Pegasus lost its legitimacy overnight.
- It now operates as a **vigilante organization** — pursuing what it considers 'good' by its own definition, without mandate or accountability.
- Currently at war with Rose.
- Maintains a covert operations base in Oniofast (State of Akison).
- Controls or heavily influences the Republic of Oredsy.

### **Rose**

- Founded in **Year 780** by ex-Pegasus members who witnessed the organization's corruption and left specifically to combat it. Rose was created to destroy Pegasus, prevent it from rebuilding its continental membership, and ensure no nation could be leveraged into funding or rejoining it.
- The war between Rose and Pegasus has continued without pause since 780 ACC. Strikes and attacks occur almost every week across the continent.
- Leadership conducts covert meetings in Anehull (Kingdom of Vacron).
- Maintains HQ in Uyrand (Kingdom of Iyhago).
- Provides protection to the neutral forge in Clocester.

### **Butterfly**

- Organization of the most powerful Metas (see: Magi Types).
- Fights against corruption and crime syndicates — Rose, Pegasus, and Arashi.
- Helps forge alliances between magic societies across different kingdoms.
- HQ is in Klanron (Kingdom of Vacron).
- Operates a secret monitoring station in Icogas (Republic of Oredsy).

### **Arashi**

- A powerful criminal organization with hidden underlying goals beyond ordinary crime.
- Has 13 ranked members (#0–#12). See: Arashi Members for full profiles.
- The age of the organization is unknown — the identity and origins of **#0** remain unresolved. The Arashi was formally designated a terrorist organization approximately **50 years before the current era** (c. Year 950 ACC). What the organization was before that designation — or how long it had been operating — is not publicly established.

### **Ace**

- A group of exactly **52** powerful mercenaries for hire. Services include security, assassination, and kidnapping — as long as payment is provided.
- Extremely mysterious. Far less is publicly known about them than the Arashi.
- Every member wears a mask with a playing card symbol — their identifier within the organization. Members also wear suit-colored clothing or markings corresponding to their division.
- **Structure:** 4 Suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs), each with 13 ranked members (Ace through King). The **Ace of Spades** holds supreme authority and the organization's final word on all decisions. Members are identified only by their rank and suit — no names are used in official operations.
- Founded during the **War of Fodon** as a response to the chaotic mercenary market that war produced. The founders believed formalized structure, fixed pricing, and a code of conduct (perform the contract or return the payment) would produce a more reliable and therefore more profitable operation than freelance alternatives.
- **Known Operations:** Enforced order in Adlens under contract with the local government. Conducted operations in Fodon during the major conflict period. Involved in the Goldhelm succession crisis following King Aldric's death — hired by the new General to eliminate political opponents during the transition period.

### **Crimson Rooks**

- Founded in **Year 712** — the same year the Kingdom of Vacron was formally established as a centralized state. The two institutions grew together, and the Rooks are deeply embedded in Vacron's political system while operating independently across the continent.
- Purpose: To keep order throughout the world of Eldunary.
- Act as world peacekeepers, often enforcing order where governments collapse.
- HQ is located in Vacron (Kingdom of Vacron), in a heavily fortified compound guarded by elite officers and surveillance tech.
- Maintains an outpost in Ubraamore (Kingdom of Iyhago).
- Keeps Anehull under constant surveillance.
- Many citizens see them as both protectors and watchers.

### **Magic Societies**

- Societies of the most powerful and influential magic users in each kingdom (except the Goldhelm Kingdom, where magic is banned).
- Function as part of each kingdom's government.
- **Active Societies (7):** Vacron • Oredsy • Fodon • Iyhago • Ipadora • Akison • Nikolem
- Meeting point for all Magic Societies is **Klanron** (Kingdom of Vacron).
- The **Butterfly organization** serves as an unofficial bridge between Magic Societies across kingdoms — facilitating alliances, joint training, and intelligence sharing that formal diplomatic channels cannot easily accommodate.

# **XII.  Major Characters**

Profiles of key named individuals in Eldunary beyond the Arashi, Masters, and Families of Power sections.

### **Fluffy — The Fleece-Bearer**

| Title | The Fleece-Bearer (informal — Fluffy has no true name) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Unknown — primordial entity |
| **Age** | Predates the Crimson Convergence by thousands of years. One of the oldest known beings in Eldunary. |
| **Location** | Unknown. Fluffy has no fixed home and appears only when it chooses to. |
| **Power Rank** | #1 — The most powerful known being in Eldunary. |
| **Abilities** | Omnipotent magical authority. Can give, take, transfer, or nullify any form of magic. Can enchant any item with any magical property. Stores thousands of enchanted items within its fleece, granting it functionally infinite magical power. Communicates telepathically. The closest classification for its abilities is Meta magic, but Fluffy transcends all known Magi categories. It is regarded as the god of all magic users. |
| **Appearance** | Fluffy wears an enormous, distinctive fleece that obscures its true form. What lies beneath the fleece — if anything — is unknown. The fleece itself is not merely clothing but a vessel of power, containing thousands of stored magical items. The name 'Fluffy' was given by others based on the fleece's appearance, as the entity has no known true name. |
| **Personality** | Passive and non-interventionist. Despite possessing the power to do virtually anything, Fluffy has never intervened in any conflict in recorded history. It appears only in the most extraordinary circumstances and for reasons known only to itself. |
| **History** | Fluffy existed during the Dragon Era, thousands of years before the Crimson Convergence. It has known the Golem King since the beginning of time — the two are believed to have been born or created around the same period, near the very origin of Eldunary. Both entered dormancy before the Convergence. In the 1,000 years since the Convergence, Fluffy has been publicly sighted only **five times**: *(1)* the Dragon Era itself (pre-Convergence witnesses only); *(2)* the Crimson Convergence (Year 0); *(3)* the Equinox of Power **(795 ACC)**, where it appeared during the three-way Masters' stalemate and gifted the Crimson Knight his blazer upon the choice for peace; *(4)* during the **Ipadora Atrocities (901 ACC)** — the most poorly documented and disputed appearance; *(5)* during the **Northern Earthquake (957 ACC)**. It has never explained its appearances or its motives. See: The Five Public Appearances of Fluffy (History). |
| **Key Relationships** | Only three known beings have personally interacted with Fluffy: the Crimson Knight, Zunarorth, and the Golem King. Fluffy gifted the Crimson Knight his indestructible crimson velvet blazer as recognition of his peacekeeping efforts in Criozevan. The nature of Fluffy's interactions with Zunarorth is unknown. Fluffy and the Golem King share the oldest known relationship in Eldunary — they have known each other since before recorded history. |
| **Public Perception** | Revered as a deity by many magic users. Most people in Criozevan have never seen Fluffy and regard it as somewhere between a god and a myth. Its five public appearances in 1,000 years are treated as sacred historical events by those who witnessed them. |

---

### **The Crimson Knight**

| Title | The Crimson Knight |
| :---- | :---- |
| **True Name** | Known only to a select few. Never publicly revealed. |
| **Race** | Folkwynd |
| **Birthplace** | Vacron (Kingdom of Vacron) |
| **Age** | Appears approximately 40 years old. True age is significantly older — his aging was halted when Fluffy gifted him the enchanted blazer. |
| **Location** | Vacron — Crimson Rooks HQ |
| **Power Rank** | #2 — The second most powerful known being in Eldunary. |
| **Abilities** | The Crimson Knight possesses no magical abilities of his own. His power comes from extraordinary combat skill, two legendary items, and unmatched charisma. He is arguably the greatest pure fighter alive — a master of the greatsword with centuries of accumulated experience. His charisma is legendary: he can charm virtually anyone and convince people of almost anything. He is widely considered the most well-liked being in all of Criozevan. |
| **Equipment** | **The Crimson Blazer:** A crimson red velvet blazer worn over his knight's armor. Enchanted by Fluffy to be completely indestructible. The blazer also grants its wearer eternal youth and an extended lifespan. Fluffy gave it to the Crimson Knight as a gift in recognition of his efforts to bring peace to Criozevan — approximately 20 years after he founded the Crimson Rooks. |
| | **The Crimson Greatsword:** A massive sword forged from a special steel accessible only to the Golem King, who gave it to the Crimson Knight as a gift of friendship. The sword absorbs the kinetic energy of every impact it receives. In its base state, the blade is dull and dark gray. As it absorbs more hits, it gradually turns redder and redder. When fully charged, the wielder can release all stored energy in a single swing — making the next strike approximately 100 times more powerful than normal. The longer a fight lasts, the more dangerous the Crimson Knight becomes. |
| **Personality** | Charismatic, warm, and deeply principled. The Crimson Knight leads through presence and persuasion rather than fear. He is universally respected and genuinely liked across nearly every kingdom in Criozevan. Despite his power and influence, he remains approachable and grounded. He seeks guidance from the Golem King, whom he considers his mentor. |
| **History** | Born a Folkwynd in Vacron, the Crimson Knight rose to prominence through his vision of a peaceful, ordered world. He founded the Crimson Rooks as a peacekeeping force and built it into the most respected organization on the continent. Approximately 20 years after founding the Rooks, Fluffy appeared and gifted him the indestructible crimson blazer — halting his aging and cementing his legendary status. The Golem King, recognizing a kindred spirit, befriended him and gifted him the special steel for his greatsword. The Crimson Knight considers the Golem King his mentor and frequently seeks his guidance. |
| **The Hardest Thing He Ever Did** | During the Second Great War, the Crimson Knight fights King Aldric directly — the confrontation he spent his entire career trying never to have. He overestimates Aldric's resilience and releases the Crimson Greatsword's stored energy at half-charge, intending a knockback. The force throws Aldric into a tree. A branch impales him. Aldric dies without ever seeing Seraphina again — the daughter he started the war to reclaim. The Knight did not mean to kill him. He has to live with that forever: not a deliberate execution but a miscalculation, which is worse. The war broke him. He rebuilds — using the guilt to make the Rooks better than before, more careful, more restrained — but he is not the same man. |
| **The Exile Council** | At the joint council convened to decide Seraphina's fate after the Book 3 climax, the Crimson Knight does not speak. Every kingdom representative argues. He sits in silence. His silence is the most damning vote in the room — the man who spent a thousand years arguing for mercy, who has never once failed to find the words, finds none. He cannot counter what everyone saw. He cannot promise it won't happen again. He says nothing, and the exile passes. |
| **Key Relationships** | **Fluffy:** Gifted him the blazer. One of only three beings to have interacted with Fluffy. |
| | **Golem King:** Close friend and mentor. Gave him the steel for his greatsword. The Crimson Knight regularly visits him in Nikolem for counsel. |
| | **Zunarorth:** One of the three who have interacted with Fluffy alongside the CK, but the nature of the CK's direct relationship with Zunarorth is unclear. |
| **Public Perception** | Universally admired. The Crimson Knight is the face of justice and order in Criozevan. Even kingdoms that resent the Crimson Rooks' authority tend to respect the man himself. |

---

### **The Golem King**

| Title | The Golem King |
| :---- | :---- |
| **True Name** | Has a true name in Karthrun (the Golem language). Not publicly known. |
| **Race** | Primordial entity / Golem progenitor |
| **Age** | Predates the Crimson Convergence by thousands of years. One of the oldest known beings in Eldunary alongside Fluffy. |
| **Location** | The largest, most isolated mountain in the Nikolem Kingdom. He has never left it since the Crimson Convergence. |
| **Power Rank** | #4 — However, this ranking is misleading. The Golem King is believed to possess power equal to Fluffy's. He is ranked lower solely because he chooses never to use his full power. He has no desire to be the strongest, control territory beyond Nikolem, or involve himself in the affairs of the wider world. |
| **Abilities** | Creator of all Golems — the only being capable of forging true sentient Golems using ancient rune forges. Master of rune magic on a scale no other being can approach. His full capabilities are unknown because he so rarely exercises them. The Golem King uses his power only for what he considers good, and even then, sparingly. He rarely creates new Golems — only when the kingdom truly needs them. |
| **Appearance** | Visually distinct from all other Golems. Stands approximately 100 feet tall — dwarfing even the largest of his creations (8–9 ft). His body is covered in thousands of runes, their purposes largely unknown. No member of the public has seen the Golem King since the Crimson Convergence. |
| **Personality** | Wise, patient, philosophical, and deeply protective. The Golem King is an ancient guardian who views the world with a perspective shaped by thousands of years of existence. He speaks rarely and acts even more rarely, but when he does, the consequences are profound. He has taken on a mentorship role with the Crimson Knight, offering guidance and counsel. |
| **History** | The Golem King existed during the Dragon Era, long before the Crimson Convergence. He and Fluffy are believed to have been born or created around the same time, near the very origin of Eldunary, and have known each other for all of time. At some point before the Convergence — during the Age of Elves — the Golem King entered a deep dormancy within the Jagged Mountains. A small number of elven explorers ventured deep enough into the rock to find him sleeping there. They did not know what he was, only that his presence was deeply wrong in some way they could not articulate. They fled without disturbing him. No formal record of these encounters survived the Convergence, and they exist now only as scattered fragments of legend. The Convergence awakened him. He then began creating Golems. The reason he started making them — what his intentions were, what he needed them for, or whether there was a goal beyond the act of creation itself — is not known. He has not explained it. He established the Nikolem Kingdom over the Golems' early centuries and placed powerful runes throughout the region — including deep in what is now the Darkmane forest. Those runes became unstable after the Golem King stopped maintaining them due to ongoing wars, and their original purpose remains a mystery. |
| **Key Relationships** | **Fluffy:** The oldest known relationship in Eldunary. They have known each other since before recorded history and are believed to be equals in raw power. |
| | **Crimson Knight:** Close friend and apprentice. The Golem King gifted him the special steel for the Crimson Greatsword out of friendship and serves as his mentor. |
| **Mysteries** | Why the Golem King began creating Golems after waking from dormancy — what purpose he had in mind, if any — has never been explained. Why he guards Nikolem so fiercely while showing no interest in any other territory remains unexplained. The original purpose of the runes he placed in the Darkmane forest is unknown. His true name in Karthrun has never been publicly revealed. |
| **Farewell to Seraphina** | Before Seraphina crosses the sea into exile, the Golem King speaks to her — the only farewell she receives from someone who truly understands what she is. He tells her she is the first new thing in a thousand years, and that the world has always feared what it cannot categorize. He does not tell her the exile is wrong, or that it will end, or that she will be forgiven. He tells her the truth. It is the kindest thing anyone says to her. |

### **Zunarorth — The Last Dragon**

| Title | Zunarorth, the Last Dragon |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Dragon |
| **Age** | Thousands of years old — predates the Crimson Convergence. A survivor of the Dragon Era. |
| **Location** | Unknown. Zunarorth has not been reliably seen in hundreds of years. |
| **Power Rank** | #3 — Ancient and feared. |
| **Abilities** | Largely unknown in the current era. During the Dragon Era, dragons were powerful and intelligent beings capable of reshaping landscapes. Zunarorth is presumed to retain all of these abilities, but he has not been observed using them in living memory. |
| **Appearance** | Unknown in the current era. No confirmed physical description exists from recent centuries. |
| **Personality** | Solitary and elusive, consistent with the nature of dragons during the Dragon Era. Dragons were intelligent but not social — they did not build civilizations, form governments, or leave written records. They were solitary territorial beings of immense individual power. Zunarorth's extreme reclusiveness in the current era is believed to stem from the trauma of the dragon extinction. |
| **History** | Zunarorth lived during the Dragon Era, when dragons dominated the world of Eldunary. That era ended when a mysterious entity known only as The Shadow appeared and systematically exterminated every dragon on the planet. The Shadow's origin is unknown — theories suggest it may have come from a more advanced civilization on a distant continent or from another dimension entirely. After completing its slaughter, The Shadow vanished and has never been seen again. Zunarorth is the sole known survivor, having managed to escape and hide from The Shadow. This experience is believed to be the reason he emerges from hiding so rarely. |
| **Current Status** | Zunarorth's existence in the current era is somewhere between fact and legend. He is known to have survived the Dragon Era, and the Crimson Knight, Golem King, and Fluffy have all interacted with him. However, no member of the general public has reliably seen him in hundreds of years. Approximately every 100 years, a sighting is reported somewhere in Eldunary — but these could be rumors. Whether Zunarorth is still alive, still hiding, or has left Criozevan entirely is unknown. |
| **Anton's Approach** | Anton seeks out Zunarorth specifically because he was alive during the first Crimson Convergence — a living witness to the event Anton wants to recreate. He approaches Zunarorth believing the dragon will understand, perhaps even support, his plan. He is wrong. Zunarorth was alive when the Convergence killed every other dragon in existence. The idea that someone would deliberately trigger a second one fills him with a fury that has no bottom. They fight to a draw. Zunarorth cannot kill Anton. Anton cannot kill Zunarorth. But the encounter forces Anton to accelerate his timeline — the dragon's existence and his rage are now variables Anton cannot control. |
| **Vorryn** | In Books 1 or 2, Vorryn becomes the first being in centuries that Zunarorth chooses to speak to. The last Tharnex and the last dragon — two endings of two different eras — find each other in the margins of a world that has moved on from both of them. They become unlikely allies. By the Book 3 climax, they arrive together — too late for the battle, in time to witness Seraphina's exile. They are the last things she sees before she crosses the sea. |
| **The Shadow** | The entity that exterminated the dragons remains the single greatest unsolved mystery of the pre-Convergence era. It appeared without warning, killed every dragon except Zunarorth, and vanished. Its origin, motives, and current status (if it still exists) are completely unknown. |

### **Princess Seraphina of Goldhelm**

| Title | Princess Seraphina |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Age** | Young adult |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Family** | Daughter of King Aldric (see: Families of Power — Goldhelm Family) |
| **Role** | Heir to the Goldhelm throne |
| **Abilities** | Seraphina carries the full re-expression of the Goldhelm bloodline's Devourer ability — the first in centuries. She is not aware of this. Her power operates in two modes. **Passive absorption:** Always active and completely unconscious. Magic users in her proximity find their abilities slowly, imperceptibly weakening over time. The rate increases with her emotional state. She spent her captivity with Anton — a powerful Scarlet — unknowingly draining him throughout their time together, which contributed to the escalating instability of his power during that period. Crucially, non-magic users (Elric, most Goldhelm soldiers) are entirely unaffected. Holotech is also unaffected, which is why Isolde never triggered the drain and why Seraphina spent her entire childhood surrounded by people she was incapable of harming. **Passive storage:** Having grown up in a kingdom with no magic users around her, Seraphina never drained living sources — but she has spent her entire life unconsciously absorbing ambient residual magical energy from the world around her: the background radiation of the Convergence, trace energies from corrupted runes, the natural magical saturation of the environment. She is a vessel that was never emptied. What was released on the Jagged Mountains was the accumulated ambient energy of approximately twenty years, discharged in a single involuntary shockwave. **The release:** When Seraphina's power discharges — always involuntarily at this stage, always triggered by extreme emotional distress — it radiates as a burst of golden warm light, producing a shockwave of raw undifferentiated magical energy. It does not target. It affects all magic users in range simultaneously. In the hours following a major release she absorbs faster than normal, creating a temporary void state dangerous to any magic user nearby. She experiences this as an unusual calm. The calm is the warning. **What she does not yet know:** That her power and corrupted rune energy are fundamentally opposed — corrupted runes recoil from her presence, destabilized by contact with her absorption field. That she was slowly draining Anton throughout her captivity. That the reason Isolde's diagnostic instruments detected anomalous readings was not that they found her power, but that they detected the absence of expected ambient energy in her vicinity — a small, consistent hole where something was being consumed. This is deeply significant given that magic is completely banned within the Goldhelm Kingdom under penalty of public execution, making the princess a walking violation of her own kingdom's most fundamental law — and one whose power, if fully understood, would rewrite the history of that law entirely. |
| **Personality** | Defiant, perceptive, and resourceful. Seraphina possesses a sharp mind and an unyielding spirit. She is deeply aware of the corruption festering beneath Goldhelm's gilded surface and harbors a genuine desire to see her kingdom reformed. She is not content to be a passive figurehead — she observes, questions, and acts with a courage that often exceeds her station's expectations. Despite her royal upbringing, she is pragmatic and adaptive, capable of enduring hardship without breaking. |
| **Background** | Raised in the Gilded Cradle of Ovodon, Seraphina grew up surrounded by the wealth and rigid hierarchy of the Goldhelm Kingdom. From a young age, she sensed that something was wrong beneath the kingdom's polished exterior — whispers of backroom deals, clandestine meetings, and corruption among the ruling class. Her awareness of these issues has shaped her into a figure who questions authority rather than blindly serving it. |
| **Strategic Importance** | As the sole heir to the Goldhelm throne and a person with undiscovered magical potential, Seraphina is one of the most strategically valuable individuals in Criozevan. Multiple factions — including the Arashi — have recognized her significance. Her latent power, if awakened, could fundamentally alter the balance of power within Goldhelm and potentially across the continent. |

### **King Aldric of Goldhelm**

| Title | King Aldric |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Role** | Ruling monarch of the Goldhelm Kingdom. Head of the Goldhelm Family. |
| **Personality** | A protective father and proud ruler. Aldric governs through the Goldhelm ideology of technocratic isolationism and racial superiority. He is fiercely protective of his daughter Seraphina and his kingdom, willing to mobilize the full resources of the Goldhelm military when either is threatened. |
| **Government** | Rules with a council of advisors from each sector: Scientific, Military, Maritime, Merchants Guild, Northern Criozevan Diplomat, and Southern Criozevan Diplomat. His word is final on matters of state. |

### **Sir Elric — Captain of the Goldhelm Guard**

| Title | Sir Elric, Captain of the Guard |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Role** | Captain of the Goldhelm royal guard. King Aldric's most trusted military officer. Personal protector of the royal family. |
| **Abilities** | A seasoned warrior and brilliant tactician. Elric is trained in the full Goldhelm military doctrine and wields holotech weaponry — including a holotech sword. He is known for his strategic mind, capable of reading battlefields and adapting plans under pressure. His combat skills place him among the finest soldiers in the Goldhelm Kingdom. |
| **Personality** | Stoic, loyal, and resolute. Elric's defining trait is his unwavering dedication to the Goldhelm royal family — particularly Princess Seraphina, whom he has protected and mentored since her childhood. He is not a man of many words, preferring action over speech, but when he does speak, his voice carries the weight of hard-earned authority. He is willing to endure any hardship and face any odds in service of his duty. |
| **Background** | Elric rose through the ranks of the Goldhelm military through skill and merit, earning the position of Captain of the Guard — the highest individual military appointment in the kingdom. He stands at King Aldric's right hand in matters of defense and security. His reputation for loyalty and tactical acumen is known throughout the Goldhelm Kingdom. |
| **Death** | Elric dies in the Second Great War — in a battle he had no reason to be in. He was not there under orders or strategy. He was there because of who he is. His death is a random act of war: the wrong place, the wrong moment, the sword of a soldier who did not know his name. This is what makes it devastating. Of all the deaths the war produces, his is the one with no meaning attached to it. There is no last message, no final lesson, no sacrifice that saves anyone. He simply does not come back. |

### **Lady Isolde — Royal Archmedic of Holometric Sciences**

| Title | Lady Isolde, Royal Archmedic of Holometric Sciences |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Role** | Head of all holometric medical science in the Goldhelm Kingdom. Senior advisor to King Aldric. Personal protector and mentor to Princess Seraphina alongside Sir Elric. Following the Second Great War, she relocates to Vacron and becomes the founding head of the Vacron Medical Institution — the most advanced medical center on the continent, built on the ruins of the war's casualties and her own need to do something with what she survived. |
| **Abilities** | Isolde is one of the most accomplished holotech specialists in the Goldhelm Kingdom. Despite common misconceptions, she is not a mage — she uses advanced holotech exclusively, in accordance with Goldhelm law. Her expertise in holometric medicine allows her to generate holotech healing fields, protective energy barriers, and diagnostic systems. She wields a holotech staff that serves as both a medical instrument and a defensive tool. Her skill with holotech is so refined that her work is often mistaken for magic by outsiders unfamiliar with Goldhelm technology. She is revered throughout the kingdom for her wisdom and scientific knowledge. |
| **Personality** | Wise, composed, and fiercely protective. Isolde carries herself with quiet authority — she rarely raises her voice, but when she speaks, her words carry the weight of deep experience and hard-earned knowledge. She is deeply devoted to Princess Seraphina, having watched over her since childhood, and her bond with the princess is maternal in nature. Isolde is willing to sacrifice anything — including her own life — to protect those in her care. Beneath her calm exterior lies an iron will and a sharp strategic mind. |
| **Background** | Isolde rose through the ranks of the Department of Holometric Advancement through exceptional skill in medical applications of holotech. Her appointment as Royal Archmedic placed her at the highest levels of Goldhelm's government, where she serves on King Aldric's council of advisors. Beyond her medical duties, she has become one of the most trusted figures in the royal household — a confidante to the king and a guardian to his daughter. Her relationship with Sir Elric is one of mutual respect and shared duty; together, they form the core of Seraphina's protection. **The secret she carries:** Years ago, during routine holometric medical scans of Seraphina as a child, Isolde's instruments detected a persistent anomaly — not a positive magical signature, but an absence. A small, consistent hole in the expected ambient energy readings in Seraphina's vicinity, as if something nearby was being continuously consumed. The readings did not match any known holotech malfunction or known magical signature. Isolde ran the scans repeatedly. The anomaly was always present around Seraphina and only around Seraphina. She buried the data, destroyed the records, and adjusted her diagnostic parameters to filter out the anomaly so that no other scientist would find it. She did not understand what it meant — only that reporting it would trigger an investigation that could cost Seraphina her life under Goldhelm law. She has been carrying this secret ever since, with no one to discuss it with and no framework to understand it. |

### **Anton — The Scarlet Mage**

| Title | Anton |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Folkwynd |
| **Age** | Born c. **885 ACC** or earlier. Over **115 years old** at the time of the current era. Appears approximately 30 — Folkwynd lifespan is ~85 years; Anton has far exceeded this. The extension is not fully explained; it may be a product of Scarlet power, deliberate magical intervention, or a consequence of events during the Wizard Uprising. |
| **Magi Type** | Scarlet (Malefici — power prone to losing control) |
| **Base of Operations** | Anton operates from a hidden compound within the Jagged Mountains — a cave system converted into a fortified hideout, with rough-hewn huts built into the rock face. The location is remote, deep within lawless and largely uninhabitable terrain, making it nearly impossible to find without prior knowledge of its existence. |
| **Abilities** | An enormously powerful Scarlet mage. Anton's magic is raw and volatile — capable of overwhelming experienced magic users with sheer force. As a Scarlet, his power can run out of control, making him both incredibly dangerous and inherently unstable. He is capable of generating devastating waves of dark energy, and his power is described as barely contained, his eyes burning with the mark of his Scarlet nature. |
| **Calling Card** | Anton is known to burn a dark, ominous symbol into the ground at locations he has occupied or passed through. The symbol's edges smolder long after his departure. It serves as both a signature and a warning — those who recognize it know that Anton has been there and that pursuit is dangerous. |
| **Personality** | Calculating, manipulative, and patient. Anton is a schemer who operates through proxies, misdirection, and psychological manipulation. He treats captives with an unsettling blend of civility and menace, using cryptic promises and half-truths to bend people toward his goals. He speaks of destiny, hidden power, and the failings of the current order — seductive rhetoric designed to recruit rather than simply coerce. |
| **Affiliations** | Anton was almost certainly a **leader within the revolutionary movement during the Wizard Uprising** (c. 880–890 ACC). His specific cell affiliations are undocumented; his name first became known during the **First Fire** (885 ACC), an early destructive incident in the Uprising's middle phase. Following increased institutional pressure after that event, he went into hiding. He became a covert operative for the **Butterfly organization** during this period — funneling resources, intelligence, and coordination support to revolutionary cells while maintaining anonymity. He later transitioned into fully independent operation. He utilized Arashi operatives (specifically Helm and Oto, via Spector's mirror teleportation) during the events of the trilogy but does not appear to be a formal member of the organization. His relationship with the Arashi seems transactional. |
| **Goals** | Anton's true objective is to trigger a second Crimson Convergence — a full reset of the world's magical and political order, mirroring the event that reshaped all life on Eldunary a thousand years ago. He believes the current order is irredeemably corrupt and that only a second Convergence can redistribute power the way the first one did. He is not trying to destroy the world. He genuinely believes he is saving it. This makes him sympathetic and terrifying in equal measure. His interest in Seraphina is specific: he believes a Devourer who has spent years accumulating ambient magical energy could, at the moment of maximum absorption, release everything simultaneously — producing a shockwave large enough to trigger the Convergence. He is using her as a living catalyst. He almost certainly suspected the nature of her power before abducting her, though how he came to this knowledge is unknown. |
| **Death** | Anton is killed by Seraphina in the Book 3 climax. When he attempts to trigger the Convergence, she absorbs him completely — draining his Scarlet energy until he has nothing left. He dies empty, stripped of the power that defined him, still believing he was right. He does not recant. He does not doubt. **His Certainty:** At some point — through methods he never disclosed — Anton determined what actually caused the first Crimson Convergence. This knowledge, which would constitute the most significant piece of historical information in Eldunary's thousand-year recorded history, died with him when Seraphina drained him; he took it to his grave. No one else had it. No one else has recovered it. |

### **Queen Nayele of the Tide**

| Title | Queen Nayele of the Tide |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Ipadora (Fish-type) |
| **Role** | Reigning queen of the Ipadora Kingdom. Head of House Nereval (main line). |
| **Location** | Ipadora Sanctuary |
| **Personality** | Deeply compassionate and deliberate. Nayele is known for extensive consultation before any major decision — a governing style that critics describe as slow and indecisive, and supporters argue is the reason Ipadora has not entered an unnecessary war in a generation. She is genuinely trusted by most of her subjects. |
| **Governance** | Introduced **waterway tax reform** that restructured Ipadora's historically punishing transit fees into a tiered system based on cargo type and vessel origin — a significant political compromise that reduced revenue in the short term but substantially reduced diplomatic friction with neighboring kingdoms. Presides over the IJS (Ipadora Justice System) and the ISAJ (Ipadora Sanctuary Autonomous Jurisdiction). Maintains one of the largest naval military forces on the continent. |
| **Key Relationships** | Appointed her kinsman Vaelen to govern Glaril in 996 ACC, establishing House Abyrath as a formally autonomous cadet branch. The relationship between them is cooperative — she respects his governing judgment and does not seek to micromanage the autonomous Glaril government. |

---

### **Prince Vaelen — Governor of Glaril**

| Title | Prince Vaelen |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Ipadora (Fish-type) |
| **Role** | Head of House Abyrath. Governor of Glaril. Appointed by Queen Nayele in **996 ACC**. |
| **Location** | Glaril (largest underwater city, off the coast of Akison) |
| **Governance Style** | Deliberate and consultative. Vaelen structures governance through representative councils and does not make unilateral decisions on matters affecting the population at large. Glaril under his leadership operates as a **representative democratic republic** — the only Ipadora-affiliated territory with this style of governance. |
| **Military** | Commands a diverse, relatively small military force compared to the main Ipadora navy. Focused on coastal defense and anti-piracy operations. |
| **Character** | Methodical, principled, and genuinely invested in the welfare of Glaril's mixed-species population. He is aware that Glaril has historically been governed poorly and takes the reform mandate seriously. His relationship with Nayele is built on mutual respect rather than obligation. |

# **XIII.  Trilogy Overview**

*The Tales of Eldunary* is a trilogy. The three books are **The Gilded Cage**, **The Scarlet War**, and **The Hollow Sky**. Below is a record of the confirmed shape of each book and the fates of major characters across the full arc. This section is an authorial reference document — not in-world material.

---

## **The Gilded Cage — Book 1**

**Core question:** Who is Seraphina when she has nothing left to perform?

Seraphina has spent her whole life knowing something is wrong with her — strange moments, rooms that feel different when she's frightened, magic users who seem to tire near her. She has never admitted this to herself fully. The book opens with that denial intact. By the end it is not.

The abduction by Anton's Arashi proxies, the journey through the continent, captivity in the Jagged Mountains, and the detonation on the mountainside strip away everything — kingdom, title, safety, certainty. What remains is the question the rest of the trilogy answers. She arrives at Klanron at the end of Book 1 knowing the fact of her power and nothing else. Goldhelm has been informed. The Auric Vanguard has been redirected toward her. Her father now fears her. She walks toward Klanron knowing the kingdom hunts her.

**POVs:** Seraphina, the Crimson Knight, Vorryn, Elric.

**Key events:**
- Seraphina kidnapped by Helm and Oto via Spector's teleportation
- Captivity with Anton — she unknowingly drains him throughout, accelerating his Scarlet instability
- Mountain detonation — twenty years of accumulated ambient energy discharged in a single shockwave
- Crimson Knight investigates — senses the void-shape at the blast site, is reminded of the Convergence itself
- Vorryn's storyline intersects — destroys an Arashi trafficking route, inadvertently burns financial evidence the Rooks needed
- Seraphina reaches Klanron. Epilogue: a single eye opens in the dark. Zunarorth, awake.

---

## **The Scarlet War — Book 2**

**Core question:** What do you owe the world that made you, when it wants to use you?

Aldric learns the Goldhelm founding secret — that the anti-magic ban was built to protect magic users from the royal bloodline, not to protect Goldhelm from magic. He reads it. He understands it. He seals it again. He decides the ideology is more important than the truth, and that Seraphina has been brainwashed by Vacron into thinking otherwise. He declares war.

Simultaneously, Anton seeks out Zunarorth — the only living witness to the first Convergence — and is refused with violence. The encounter ends in a draw but forces Anton to accelerate his timeline.

Sael appears for the first time as a POV character — a Darkmane warrior watching her deal with the Arashi come back as Goldhelm soldiers burning her settlements. She begins the long, grinding work of uniting the tribes.

In Klanron, the Butterfly scholar approaches Seraphina with the text fragment and the word *Devourer*. The most dangerous conversation in the book.

**POVs:** Seraphina, the Crimson Knight, Vorryn, Elric, Sael.

**Key events:**
- Aldric discovers the archive and suppresses the founding secret
- Aldric declares war on Vacron, believing they brainwashed Seraphina — the Second Great War begins
- Zunarorth and Anton fight to a draw; Anton accelerates his plan
- Butterfly scholar confronts Seraphina in Klanron — names her as a Devourer
- Sael begins uniting the Darkmane tribes
- Elric dies — in a battle he had no reason to be in, by a soldier who didn't know his name. No last words. No meaning. He simply doesn't come back.
- Vorryn finds Zunarorth — the first being the dragon has chosen to speak to in centuries

---

## **The Hollow Sky — Book 3**

**Core question:** If saving the world requires becoming the thing you feared most, do you do it?

The Second Great War reaches its crisis point. The Crimson Knight confronts Aldric directly — the hardest thing he has ever done. He releases the Greatsword's charge at half, expecting a knockback. The force is wrong. Aldric hits a tree. A branch goes through him. He dies having never seen Seraphina again. The Knight did not mean to kill him. The war ends without resolution — just silence.

Anton makes his move during the chaos. He finds the conditions he needs: the world's attention fractured, Seraphina exhausted, the ambient magical field destabilized by the war. He begins the Convergence attempt.

Seraphina absorbs him. She absorbs everything — his Scarlet power, his will, his certainty. For one moment she is not a woman. The sky changes. Everyone present sees it. Then she pulls it back. Anton dies empty, still believing he was right. Fluffy watches and does not intervene.

The joint council convenes. Kingdoms that fought each other days ago agree on one thing: they saw the sky change and they know whose hands did it. The Crimson Knight sits in silence. The exile passes.

The Golem King speaks to Seraphina before she goes. He tells her she is the first new thing in a thousand years, and that the world has always feared what it cannot categorize. It is the kindest thing anyone says to her.

Vorryn and Zunarorth arrive — too late for the battle, in time to witness. They are the last things she sees. She crosses the sea. The far shore is not on any map.

The trilogy ends on Sael — ruling a united Darkmane realm that is still fragile, still threatened, still hers. The last line suggests it could fracture again. She is still fighting.

**POVs:** Seraphina, the Crimson Knight, Vorryn, Sael.

**Key events:**
- Crimson Knight fights and accidentally kills Aldric; the Second Great War ends
- Anton's Convergence attempt — Seraphina absorbs him completely, the sky changes, she pulls it back
- Fluffy appears during the battle — does not intervene
- Anton dies unrepentant, certain he was right
- Joint exile council — the Knight says nothing; the exile passes
- Golem King's farewell to Seraphina
- Vorryn and Zunarorth witness the exile
- Seraphina crosses the sea alone — destination unknown, unreachable
- Final image: Sael ruling a fragile, united Darkmane realm
- Brief appearance of the new Goldhelm General — Aldric's successor, more ideological, colder, already eliminating opponents through hired Ace mercenaries

## **Character Fates Summary**

| Character | End State |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Seraphina** | Exiled across the sea by joint council. Alone. Unreachable. The first new thing in a thousand years, sent away. |
| **Anton** | Dead. Absorbed empty by Seraphina. Unrepentant to the last. |
| **Aldric** | Dead. Accidentally killed by the Crimson Knight — thrown into a tree branch, impaled. Dies without seeing Seraphina. |
| **Elric** | Dead. Random act of war. No meaning. No last words. |
| **Isolde** | Survives. Relocates to Vacron. Founds and leads the Vacron Medical Institution — the most advanced medical center on the continent. |
| **Crimson Knight** | Survives. Rebuilds the Rooks using guilt as fuel. A different man than he was. |
| **Golem King** | Unchanged — ancient, watching, still in his mountain. Gave Seraphina the only honest farewell she received. |
| **Zunarorth** | Alive. Allied with Vorryn. Witnessed the exile. Whereabouts after: unknown. |
| **Vorryn** | Alive. Zunarorth's ally. Never learns the full truth about the Tharnex. Carries the open question. |
| **Sael** | Alive. Rules the united Darkmane realm. The realm is fragile. She is still fighting. |
| **The Butterfly Scholar** | Fate unresolved — the partial theory about the founding secret dies incomplete. |
| **The new Goldhelm General** | Alive. In power. More dangerous than Aldric. Story continues beyond the trilogy. |
| **Arashi #0** | Never found. Fades into obscurity. The architect of everything that started this, unresolved. |

### **Sael — Warrior of the Darkmane**

| Title | Sael |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Darkmane Elf |
| **Family** | Granddaughter of Vaelith the Hollow (see: Darkmane Family) |
| **Role** | Darkmane warrior. By the end of the trilogy: first ruler of a united Darkmane realm in living memory. |
| **First Appearance** | Book 2. Book 1 establishes the Darkmane perspective through Elric's POV only — Sael does not appear until the Second Great War begins. |
| **The Deal She Made** | Before the events of Book 1, Sael made the deal that allowed Arashi passage through Darkmane territory — a desperate trade for supplies her clan needed to survive. When the consequences of that deal ripple outward and eventually bring Goldhelm forces toward her people, it is her settlements that burn. She carries the specific, personal shame of having triggered a continental crisis through one survival decision. She was not wrong to make it. She cannot stop thinking about it. |
| **Arc** | Book 2: Meets Seraphina in Vacron — two women defined by the failures of their kingdoms, neither innocent, neither entirely wrong. They become genuine friends across Books 2 and 3: two women rebuilding from the wreckage of their own decisions. Sael is the first person to tell Seraphina an uncomfortable truth she actually needs to hear. Over the course of the war, Sael unites the Darkmane tribes for the first time in generations — not through diplomacy but through fury, forcing fractious clans to point themselves at Goldhelm together. |
| **End of Trilogy** | Sael rules the united Darkmane realm — the final image of the trilogy. The realm is fragile. The last line suggests it could fracture again. She is still fighting. The war ended. Rebuilding is its own war, and she is in it. |

### **The Butterfly Scholar — Klanron**

| Title | Unknown — referred to by role only |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Affiliation** | Butterfly organization, Klanron chapter |
| **Role** | The most dangerous conversation in Book 2. |
| **Background** | A scholar within the Butterfly organization who has spent years studying an ancient pre-Convergence text fragment held in the Klanron archive. The fragment uses a word that translates roughly as *the hungry ones* — or, in more poetic rendering, *those who remember what the world was before magic had a shape.* The scholar has developed a partial theory connecting this fragment to anomalous magical phenomena reported near the Goldhelm border over centuries, but cannot prove it. When Seraphina arrives in Klanron, the scholar recognizes something in her — the absence where there should be presence, the hole in the ambient magical field — and approaches her directly. |
| **The Conversation** | The scholar tells Seraphina she is a Devourer — shows her the text fragment, explains what little is known about the classification, and asks to study her. Seraphina has to decide, in real time, how much to trust someone who has just named her as something that does not exist in any current taxonomy and who represents an organization that is already debating whether she is too dangerous to let remain in Klanron. It is the most loaded scene in Book 2. |
| **Fate** | The scholar's theory remains unproven. The connection to the Goldhelm founding secret is never completed. What the scholar knows dies with the gap between the fragment and the archive — two pieces of a truth that never fully find each other. |

---

### **The New Goldhelm General**

| Title | Unknown — referred to as the General |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Role** | Military general who seizes power in the chaos following Aldric's death. Rules Goldhelm at the close of the trilogy. |
| **Rise to Power** | A military general who was always present, always capable, always patient — watching the throne and waiting. When Aldric dies mid-war and the question of succession becomes chaos, he does not wait for a council. He hires the Ace mercenary organization to eliminate his opponents in the transition period, one by one, quietly. By the time anyone realizes what is happening, the opposition is gone. |
| **Character** | More ideological than Aldric ever was. Where Aldric governed through pride and a protective father's instinct, the General governs through doctrine — pure, cold Goldhelm supremacy stripped of personal attachment. Aldric at least loved his daughter. The General loves the ideology itself. He appears only briefly at the end of Book 3 — just enough to establish the shape of the threat that follows the trilogy. One specific act in that brief appearance tells you everything about him. |
| **After the Trilogy** | During his reign, the south attempts to break away from Goldhelm again — echoing the Golden War. He purges every revolutionary before the movement can consolidate. The second civil war never happens because he does not allow it to begin. |
