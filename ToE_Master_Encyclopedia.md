# **III.  History**

## **The Dragon Era (Pre-Convergence)**

Long before the Crimson Convergence — thousands of years before the calendar began — the world of Eldunary was dominated by dragons. These were not mindless beasts but powerful, intelligent creatures with deep awareness of the world around them. However, they were solitary by nature. They built no cities, formed no governments, and left behind no written records. Each dragon carved out vast territories across the continents, and their presence alone shaped the landscape — scorching valleys, hollowing mountains, and splitting coastlines.

During this era, two primordial beings also existed: the entity later known as **Fluffy** and the being who would become the **Golem King**. Both are believed to have been born or created around the same time as the dragons themselves, at or near the very origin of Eldunary. Their exact nature and relationship during this period is unknown, but they are said to have known each other for all of time. Both entered a state of dormancy long before the Crimson Convergence — the Golem King sleeping deep within what would become the Jagged Mountains, and Fluffy withdrawing from the physical world entirely.

The Dragon Era ended not through natural decline but through annihilation. A mysterious entity known only as **The Shadow** appeared without warning and systematically hunted and killed every dragon on the planet. The Shadow's origin remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in Eldunary — theories range from an invasion by a more advanced civilization on a distant continent to an incursion from another dimension entirely. What is known is that The Shadow was powerful enough to destroy beings that had ruled unchallenged for millennia, and that after completing its slaughter, it vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. It has never been seen again.

Only one dragon survived: **Zunarorth**, who managed to escape and hide from The Shadow. His survival and the circumstances of his escape remain unknown to all but himself. The extinction of the dragons left an enormous power vacuum in the world — one that would not be filled until the Crimson Convergence reshaped all life on Eldunary thousands of years later.

## **The Crimson Convergence**

The Crimson Convergence is the defining cosmological event of Eldunary — the moment from which all years are measured (ACC = After Crimson Convergence).

- A red star appeared in the sky over Eldunary for exactly 40 days.
- The star drew magic out of the earth and condensed it into tangible forms — primarily runes.
- The light caused millions of years of evolution to occur in just 40 days, radically altering all species.
- Humans evolved into Folkwynd.
- The light was lethal to Elves. Every elf it touched died instantly.
  - Surviving elves retreated into the thick forests beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains. Over generations, they evolved into the Darkmane Elves. This region is now known as the Warring Darkmane Realm.
- Magic flooded from the earth into the mountains, awakening the Golem King from millions of years of slumber.
- Both the Golem King and Fluffy had existed since the Dragon Era, long before the Convergence. The Convergence did not create them — it awakened the Golem King from his ancient dormancy deep within the Jagged Mountains. Fluffy's reawakening, if it occurred at the same time, was not publicly observed.
- Humans in certain distinct climates evolved differently from the Folkwynd baseline — giving rise to the Tharnex, Ipadoras, and Shar'kai.
- When the star finally vanished, the new calendar began. All subsequent years are counted from this moment.

All maps of Criozevan are dated to Year 1000 ACC.

- Swordsmen: Standard infantry — holo-tech swords and armor.
- Spearmen: Anti-cavalry and defensive — holo-tech spears and shields.
- Medics: Healers using holotech-based support systems.
- Attack style mirrors Roman army formations. Uses natural water barriers and tech for defense.

#### **MAGIC & TECHNOLOGY**

- Magic is completely banned inside the kingdom. Use is punishable by public execution.
- Holotech is used in place of magic for everyday life, warfare, and industry.

#### **ECONOMY & TRADE**

- Autarky (self-sufficiency) is the national economic goal. All trade is restricted except with the Republic of Frada.
- Exports scientific findings and research exclusively to Frada.
- Infrastructure: Hover-rails, stone roads, and bridge networks.

#### **CULTURE & SOCIETY**

- Highly elitist. Citizens are obsessed with rising through the social hierarchy.

## **Warring Darkmane Realm**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Grousea (informal capital): Extremely shady and dangerous city. Considered the de facto capital despite no formal designation. A major criminal hub.
- Vlurg: Black market capital. Town centered around its market. Dark elf population speaks Nualthyr when they don't want to be understood.
- Wrediff: Hidden training ground for dark elf warriors. Shielded by dark elf magic — rarely seen or entered by outsiders. No markets or trade — only forges, shrines, and poison-makers. Locals speak only Nualthyr.
- Adlens: Diverse town of peaceful people — dark elves who reject violence, Golems who defected from the Golem King, and Goldhelms who fled corruption. Large port. Trade hub from GK to the southeast by boat. Peace treaty signed here.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Dense, ancient forest. Filled with hidden dangers, ambushes, and old ruins.
- Elven warfare has permanently scarred the land. Corrupted runes are scattered deep in the forest.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- Not a centralized government. A collection of scattered, warring tribes and villages.
- Constant infighting defines the realm.

#### **MILITARY**

- Tribal warbands. No unified army. Each clan fields its own warriors trained in guerilla tactics.

#### **MAGIC & TECHNOLOGY**

- Dark elves draw corrupted energy from abandoned Golem runes deep in the forest.
- Abilities include: Shadowstep, silence binding, and toxin shaping.
- Corrupted Runes: Massive, unstable runes left by the Golem King. Became unstable after the Golem King stopped maintaining them because of the ongoing war. Prone to explosions. Emit dark magic that can infect the mind — often fatal.

#### **CULTURE & SOCIETY**

- Extremely secretive. Rarely interact with outsiders except during major wars.
- Poison rites, blood-bond rituals, and soul binding define cultural practices.

#### **THE DARKMANE FAMILY & THE FALLEN**

- The Darkmane Family split due to internal corruption. Some members became 'The Fallen' — soulless, dark-magic-possessed husks.
- Other family members exiled The Fallen, causing complete societal collapse.
- Legend says The Fallen still haunt the woods. Rumors hold that if you get lost in the forest, they will take you.

#### **NOTABLE LOCATIONS**

- Abandoned Goldhelm Outpost: Deep within the Darkmane forest lie the ruins of a former Goldhelm military outpost. Years ago, the Goldhelm Kingdom attempted to maintain a strategic presence inside Darkmane territory. The outpost was abandoned when the Darkmane Realm became increasingly volatile and dangerous — the constant infighting between elven tribes and the spread of corrupted runes made the position untenable. Today, only broken buildings and remnants of old fortifications remain. The site is occasionally used as a waypoint by those traveling through the forest, but it offers no safety — the Darkmane elves have passed through repeatedly, and no garrison has held it since.

## **Nikolem Kingdom**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Suudon (Capital): City in the Golem Swamp, home of the Golem King. Not hostile but unfriendly to visitors. Shrouded in mist. Houses a vast underground network rumored to extend beneath the Great Lake. A secret underground city is rumored to exist below.
- Cridbury: Built into the foothills of the Jagged Mountains. Home to many Golems and miners. Famous for strong metal and rare minerals. Training center for heavy weapon users. Outsiders without a guide often get 'lost' in the tunnels.
- Klosdon: Forest rest stop in the middle of Nikolem. Golems live peacefully here. Few visitors, fewer rules. Known for strange glowing plants at night.
- Phaaross: Bridge city into Vacron. Strong Golem military presence. Stone wall facing Vacron. Watchtowers on all sides. Trade hub connecting northwest to northeast.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Mostly mountainous terrain — steep, jagged cliffs and deep caverns.
- Some tunnels are rumored to reach the core of Eldunary.
- Swamps surround Suudon.

#### **GOVERNMENT & POLITICS**

- The Golem King resides in the largest, most isolated mountain. Difficult to reach due to natural defenses and elevation. The kingdom effectively operates under his will.
- Golems actively monitor the entire kingdom — acting as both sentries and enforcers.

#### **MAGIC & TECHNOLOGY**

- The kingdom is rich in rune magic. Known for their forges where rune users train, acquire Runestones, and craft infused gear.

#### **INFRASTRUCTURE**

- Contains a vast underground tunnel network connecting the northernmost mountains to Suudon near the Great Lake.

## **Kingdom of Vacron**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Vacron (Capital): The largest and most populated city on the entire continent of Criozevan. Located at the geographic center of the continent. Known for its towering administrative buildings and bustling marketplaces. A key location for law, politics, and power deals. Hub for trade and commerce. Extremely strict punishments for breaking the law. Friendly to outsiders. HQ for the Crimson Rooks and residence of the Crimson Knight.
- Clocester: Former mining colony turned town. Known for crystal caverns and unstable ground (frequent collapses from underground duels). Tunnel access to KoF, RoF, and KoI borders. Mixed population of refugees and runaways. Home to a neutral forge with Rose protection. Criminal meeting ground. Central spot between Vacron, Sloumont, and Hiypolis.

- Famous for its order, stability, and no-nonsense leadership.

#### **TRADE & INFRASTRUCTURE**

- The economic heart of Criozevan. Maintains border access and trade routes to several kingdoms. Friendly to outsiders as long as the law is followed.

#### **KEY ORGANIZATIONS**

- Crimson Rooks HQ: Heavily fortified compound within the city. Guarded by elite officers and surveillance technology. The Rooks act as world peacekeepers, often enforcing order where governments collapse. They operate independently but are deeply rooted in Vacron's political system. Many citizens see them as both protectors and watchers.

## **Kingdom of Fodon**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Fodon (Capital): The second largest city in Criozevan. Located on the northwest peninsula. Arid, desert climate next to the sea. Originally divided into four war-torn districts — Bug, Magic, Death, and Fire. The districts fought for decades until Lucifer (#6 Arashi) killed all four district leaders. Now a diverse but tense metropolis marked by old ruins and district pride. Still carries the legacy of violence and survival in its streets and politics.

- District Leaders (now deceased):
  - Vorvax (Bug): Rumored to be the last matriarch of the Tharnex. Ruled from the shadows with shifting armor that sensed incoming danger. She trusted no one but her own. Her eyes missed nothing, and her will to protect the scattered bugfolk was legendary. In a city built on betrayal, Vorvax was the one presence you never saw coming — until it was far too late. Once she was killed, the rest of the Tharnex race perished.
  - Azaraith, the Nightweaver (Magic): Feared ruler of the Magic District. Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces with her staff, her power pulsing like a hidden current beneath the city's sands. No one knows what lies behind her mask, but every rumor agrees on one thing: to speak her name is to tempt fate. She judges all magic users with merciless precision, and even the Arashi once hesitated to challenge her rule.
  - Varnokh (Death): A towering armored construct powered by a magenta arcane core. His armor resembled a spiked exoskeleton, and he wielded a massive scythe-axe linked to necromantic energy. Known for his silence and ceremonial law, Varnokh ruled without emotion through death rituals and executions. His core was destroyed by Lucifer (#6 Arashi) during the fall of the districts. His body was never recovered.
  - Vulkran (Fire): A knight of molten steel and volcanic power. Wielded a lava-blade and obsidian shield, with a burning eye-core at his chest. His armor could melt sand into glass. Vulkran was slain by Lucifer (#6 Arashi) during the collapse of the Warring Districts. His remains lie entombed in a fire-cracked canyon near Plodrough — still warm to this day. Born in Zhuiburn.

- Mayson: Desert town in the Kingdom of Fodon. Crypt-based desert town with layers of burial tunnels and ruins.
- Plodrough: Desert town built into a canyon. Canyon-side underground city, carved vertically into the cliffs.
- Sloumont: Dry plains farming town. Expansive. Near a river. Small agricultural port with a small river port for trade.

#### **GEOGRAPHY & ENVIRONMENT**

- Northwestern region of Criozevan. Harsh desert with dry plains, jagged cliffs, and scorched canyons.
- Includes underground towns, ancient crypts, and limited coastal access. Formerly warmer, now dry and wind-blasted.

#### **GOVERNMENT — THE DUNE ACCORD**

- A unique governing system born from the civil war. Named after the survival pact signed at the site where Fire District Leader Vulkran erupted in death — melting a canyon into Ashglass Hall.
- Ashglass Hall: Made of black obsidian and lava glass, glowing with heat veins and scorched stone. Council debates happen beneath molten-stone pillars and hanging lava-stained stalactites. Ashglass Hall itself is a physical reminder of past destruction and the cost of disunity.
- Four High Seats: Each representing a former district (Bug, Magic, Death, Fire). Elected by district population and surrounding towns. All four seats hold equal voting power.
- Voice of Sand: A fifth seat elected by the entire kingdom every five years. Holds power to break ties, pass emergency orders, and represent Fodon internationally. Known as 'the Will of the Wastes' — one who speaks not for a city, but for the land. Traditionally seen as a symbol of national unity beyond the fractured district lines.
- The Dune Accord governs all of Fodon, including remote desert outposts and crypt towns. It prioritizes balance between local power and central authority. The system emphasizes pragmatic leadership, war memory, and shared survival in a brutal land.

#### **HISTORICAL CONFLICTS**

- Allied with Frada in a massive war against Ipadora. Drove Ipadora off the mainland and seized former Ipadora territory. Cut a manmade river to divide Fodon from its defeated foe. This conquest remains a source of national identity and pride.

## **State of Akison**

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Akison (Island Capital): A city that encompasses its entire island. Built like a five-petaled cherry blossom expanding outward from the central palace. Inspired by ancient Japanese cities — curved rooftops, zen courtyards, fortified bamboo walls, stone walkways over water. Trade and travel hub to other continents. Friendly to outsiders. Known for its martial government, rogue tech zones, and world trade access.

- The Five Blossom Rings (Sakura-go):
  - Tetsukaku (鉄閣, 'Iron Heights'): Central petal and government district. Home to the Iron Bloom (Sunlee's palace and the Tetsugan meeting hall). Lined with stone watchtowers, ritual gardens, and elevated ceremonial halls.
  - Koganemura (黄金村, 'Golden Village'): Martial training petal — temples, dojos, and tournament grounds. Monks, swordsmen, and Iron Path initiates live and train here. Hosts annual martial festivals and public spar duels.
  - Uramizu (裏水, 'Hidden Waters'): Subterranean and canal-filled black market zone and criminal underbelly. Curved alleys, shadow bridges, and hidden gates form a maze under the surface. Policed unofficially by old guilds and smugglers who answer to no one but tradition.
  - Harashima (原島, 'Sprawling Isle'): Riverfront petal — Akison's economic lifeline and port district. Houses foreign embassies, trader towers, and floating market barges. Known for its cranes, sails, and midnight auctions.
  - Shōmeika (照明花, 'Luminous Blossom'): Cultural and spiritual heart of the city — where art, music, and religion converge. Filled with blossom-viewing temples, ink halls, and ancestral gardens. Night is lit by paper lanterns, spirit drums, and performance arenas.

- Kurashiki Region (Northern Island Mountains): Located in the cherry blossom-lined peaks of Akison's island. Known for its cold mists, sparse mountaintop settlements, and ancient dueling sites. Home to powerful samurai and shinobi clans, each guarding unique traditions and secrets. Difficult to navigate — most outsiders are watched or rejected unless sponsored by a clan. Governed through clan law, but all swear conditional loyalty to the Iron Path.

- Kurashiki Lords: Ancient bloodlines rooted in mountaintop keeps and cherry blossom valleys. Each clan controls schools, shrines, and assassin orders unique to their house. Some clans train warriors for the Blades of the Iron Path in exchange for influence.

- Oniofast (Mainland): Jungle town built into ancient shifting ruins. HQ for covert Pegasus operations. Streets are half-mechanical, half-organic. Constantly shifting. Rose, Butterfly, and magis are banned by silent agreement — entry is suicide. Known for its annual 'Signal Harvest,' when rogue tech is extracted from the jungle. Locals trained in survival, stealth, and encryption.

- Governs through personal strength, respect, and the doctrine of discipline and clarity.
- The Tetsugan ('Iron Eye Council'): 4 Kurashiki Clan Emissaries, 5 City Keepers (one from each of the five Sakura-go districts: Tetsukaku, Koganemura, Uramizu, Harashima, Shōmeika), and 2 Tora no Shūjin ('Prison Tigers' — Sunlee's appointed field enforcers). The council meets within the Iron Bloom, a fortress directly in the center of the city, resembling a Japanese temple, guarded by invisible shinobi in every shadow of the building. Votes are held only when Sunlee allows — his silence overrides any tie.

#### **CAPITAL & SETTLEMENTS**

- Frada (Capital): Administrative and command core of the republic. Built around the Glass Bastion citadel (a transparent dome of reinforced crystal that reflects spells and projectiles). Grid-like road layout for strategic movement and quick lockdowns. Factories, barracks, and research hubs form concentric layers around the central command tower. Civilians live in standardized housing zones under curfews and sector codes. Large central plaza used for military parades, oath ceremonies, and execution drills. Diverse but weak government. Medium crime. Doesn't prioritize outsiders.

Divided into training zones, living blocks, and the Foundry Belt (a district of tech labs and gear manufactories). Built along a riverbank between the sea and a shielded inland base. In wartime, the entire city can transform into a mobile supply fortress via rail barge and sky towers. Closest non-desert city to Ipadora Sanctuary. Direct connection to Ipadora Kingdom. Produces custom holo-tech weaponry for Goldhelm, Oredsy, and certain Pegasus-aligned factions.

### **Fluffy — The Fleece-Bearer**

| Title | The Fleece-Bearer (informal — Fluffy has no true name) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Unknown — primordial entity |
| **Age** | Predates the Crimson Convergence by thousands of years. One of the oldest known beings in Eldunary. |
| **Location** | Unknown. Fluffy has no fixed home and appears only when it chooses to. |
| **Power Rank** | #1 — The most powerful known being in Eldunary. |
| **Abilities** | Omnipotent magical authority. Can give, take, transfer, or nullify any form of magic. Can enchant any item with any magical property. Stores thousands of enchanted items within its fleece, granting it functionally infinite magical power. Communicates telepathically. The closest classification for its abilities is Meta magic, but Fluffy transcends all known Magi categories. It is regarded as the god of all magic users. |
| **Appearance** | Fluffy wears an enormous, distinctive fleece that obscures its true form. What lies beneath the fleece — if anything — is unknown. The fleece itself is not merely clothing but a vessel of power, containing thousands of stored magical items. The name 'Fluffy' was given by others based on the fleece's appearance, as the entity has no known true name. |
| **Personality** | Passive and non-interventionist. Despite possessing the power to do virtually anything, Fluffy has never intervened in any conflict in recorded history. It appears only in the most extraordinary circumstances and for reasons known only to itself. |
| **History** | Fluffy existed during the Dragon Era, thousands of years before the Crimson Convergence. It has known the Golem King since the beginning of time — the two are believed to have been born or created around the same period, near the very origin of Eldunary. Both entered dormancy before the Convergence. In the 1,000 years since the Convergence, Fluffy has been publicly sighted only five times. It has never explained its appearances or its motives. |
| **Key Relationships** | Only three known beings have personally interacted with Fluffy: the Crimson Knight, Zunarorth, and the Golem King. Fluffy gifted the Crimson Knight his indestructible crimson velvet blazer as recognition of his peacekeeping efforts in Criozevan. The nature of Fluffy's interactions with Zunarorth is unknown. Fluffy and the Golem King share the oldest known relationship in Eldunary — they have known each other since before recorded history. |
| **Public Perception** | Revered as a deity by many magic users. Most people in Criozevan have never seen Fluffy and regard it as somewhere between a god and a myth. Its five public appearances in 1,000 years are treated as sacred historical events by those who witnessed them. |

### **The Crimson Knight**

| Title | The Crimson Knight |
| :---- | :---- |
| **True Name** | Known only to a select few. Never publicly revealed. |
| **Race** | Folkwynd |
| **Birthplace** | Vacron (Kingdom of Vacron) |
| **Age** | Appears approximately 40 years old. True age is significantly older — his aging was halted when Fluffy gifted him the enchanted blazer. |
| **Location** | Vacron — Crimson Rooks HQ |
| **Power Rank** | #2 — The second most powerful known being in Eldunary. |
| **Abilities** | The Crimson Knight possesses no magical abilities of his own. His power comes from extraordinary combat skill, two legendary items, and unmatched charisma. He is arguably the greatest pure fighter alive — a master of the greatsword with centuries of accumulated experience. His charisma is legendary: he can charm virtually anyone and convince people of almost anything. He is widely considered the most well-liked being in all of Criozevan. |
| **Equipment** | **The Crimson Blazer:** A crimson red velvet blazer worn over his knight's armor. Enchanted by Fluffy to be completely indestructible. The blazer also grants its wearer eternal youth and an extended lifespan. Fluffy gave it to the Crimson Knight as a gift in recognition of his efforts to bring peace to Criozevan — approximately 20 years after he founded the Crimson Rooks. |
| | **The Crimson Greatsword:** A massive sword forged from a special steel accessible only to the Golem King, who gave it to the Crimson Knight as a gift of friendship. The sword absorbs the kinetic energy of every impact it receives. In its base state, the blade is dull and dark gray. As it absorbs more hits, it gradually turns redder and redder. When fully charged, the wielder can release all stored energy in a single swing — making the next strike approximately 100 times more powerful than normal. The longer a fight lasts, the more dangerous the Crimson Knight becomes. |
| **Personality** | Charismatic, warm, and deeply principled. The Crimson Knight leads through presence and persuasion rather than fear. He is universally respected and genuinely liked across nearly every kingdom in Criozevan. Despite his power and influence, he remains approachable and grounded. He seeks guidance from the Golem King, whom he considers his mentor. |
| **History** | Born a Folkwynd in Vacron, the Crimson Knight rose to prominence through his vision of a peaceful, ordered world. He founded the Crimson Rooks (OMWPOD — the Organization of Monitoring World Peace Order Division) as a peacekeeping force and built it into the most respected organization on the continent. Approximately 20 years after founding the Rooks, Fluffy appeared and gifted him the indestructible crimson blazer — halting his aging and cementing his legendary status. The Golem King, recognizing a kindred spirit, befriended him and gifted him the special steel for his greatsword. The Crimson Knight considers the Golem King his mentor and frequently seeks his guidance. |
| **Key Relationships** | **Fluffy:** Gifted him the blazer. One of only three beings to have interacted with Fluffy. |
| | **Golem King:** Close friend and mentor. Gave him the steel for his greatsword. The Crimson Knight regularly visits him in Nikolem for counsel. |
| | **Zunarorth:** One of the three who have interacted with Fluffy alongside the CK, but the nature of the CK's direct relationship with Zunarorth is unclear. |
| **Public Perception** | Universally admired. The Crimson Knight is the face of justice and order in Criozevan. Even kingdoms that resent the Crimson Rooks' authority tend to respect the man himself. |

### **The Golem King**

| Title | The Golem King |
| :---- | :---- |
| **True Name** | Has a true name in Karthrun (the Golem language). Not publicly known. |
| **Race** | Primordial entity / Golem progenitor |
| **Age** | Predates the Crimson Convergence by thousands of years. One of the oldest known beings in Eldunary alongside Fluffy. |
| **Location** | The largest, most isolated mountain in the Nikolem Kingdom. He has never left it since the Crimson Convergence. |
| **Power Rank** | #4 — However, this ranking is misleading. The Golem King is believed to possess power equal to Fluffy's. He is ranked lower solely because he chooses never to use his full power. He has no desire to be the strongest, control territory beyond Nikolem, or involve himself in the affairs of the wider world. |
| **Abilities** | Creator of all Golems — the only being capable of forging true sentient Golems using ancient rune forges. Master of rune magic on a scale no other being can approach. His full capabilities are unknown because he so rarely exercises them. The Golem King uses his power only for what he considers good, and even then, sparingly. He rarely creates new Golems — only when the kingdom truly needs them. |
| **Appearance** | Visually distinct from all other Golems. Stands approximately 100 feet tall — dwarfing even the largest of his creations (8–9 ft). His body is covered in thousands of runes, their purposes largely unknown. No member of the public has seen the Golem King since the Crimson Convergence. |
| **Personality** | Wise, patient, philosophical, and deeply protective. The Golem King is an ancient guardian who views the world with a perspective shaped by thousands of years of existence. He speaks rarely and acts even more rarely, but when he does, the consequences are profound. He has taken on a mentorship role with the Crimson Knight, offering guidance and counsel. |
| **History** | The Golem King existed during the Dragon Era, long before the Crimson Convergence. He and Fluffy are believed to have been born or created around the same time, near the very origin of Eldunary, and have known each other for all of time. At some point before the Convergence, the Golem King entered a deep dormancy within the Jagged Mountains. The Convergence awakened him, and he established the Nikolem Kingdom, creating Golems to inhabit and guard it. He placed powerful runes throughout the region — including deep in what is now the Darkmane forest. Those runes became unstable after the Golem King stopped maintaining them due to ongoing wars, and their original purpose remains a mystery. |
| **Key Relationships** | **Fluffy:** The oldest known relationship in Eldunary. They have known each other since before recorded history and are believed to be equals in raw power. |
| | **Crimson Knight:** Close friend and apprentice. The Golem King gifted him the special steel for the Crimson Greatsword out of friendship and serves as his mentor. |
| **Mysteries** | Why the Golem King guards Nikolem so fiercely while showing no interest in any other territory remains unexplained. The original purpose of the runes he placed in the Darkmane forest is unknown. His true name in Karthrun has never been publicly revealed. |

### **Zunarorth — The Last Dragon**

| Title | Zunarorth, the Last Dragon |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Dragon |
| **Age** | Thousands of years old — predates the Crimson Convergence. A survivor of the Dragon Era. |
| **Location** | Unknown. Zunarorth has not been reliably seen in hundreds of years. |
| **Power Rank** | #3 — Ancient and feared. |
| **Abilities** | Largely unknown in the current era. During the Dragon Era, dragons were powerful and intelligent beings capable of reshaping landscapes. Zunarorth is presumed to retain all of these abilities, but he has not been observed using them in living memory. |
| **Appearance** | Unknown in the current era. No confirmed physical description exists from recent centuries. |
| **Personality** | Solitary and elusive, consistent with the nature of dragons during the Dragon Era. Dragons were intelligent but not social — they did not build civilizations, form governments, or leave written records. They were solitary territorial beings of immense individual power. Zunarorth's extreme reclusiveness in the current era is believed to stem from the trauma of the dragon extinction. |
| **History** | Zunarorth lived during the Dragon Era, when dragons dominated the world of Eldunary. That era ended when a mysterious entity known only as The Shadow appeared and systematically exterminated every dragon on the planet. The Shadow's origin is unknown — theories suggest it may have come from a more advanced civilization on a distant continent or from another dimension entirely. After completing its slaughter, The Shadow vanished and has never been seen again. Zunarorth is the sole known survivor, having managed to escape and hide from The Shadow. This experience is believed to be the reason he emerges from hiding so rarely. |
| **Current Status** | Zunarorth's existence in the current era is somewhere between fact and legend. He is known to have survived the Dragon Era, and the Crimson Knight, Golem King, and Fluffy have all interacted with him. However, no member of the general public has reliably seen him in hundreds of years. Approximately every 100 years, a sighting is reported somewhere in Eldunary — but these could be rumors. Whether Zunarorth is still alive, still hiding, or has left Criozevan entirely is unknown. |
| **The Shadow** | The entity that exterminated the dragons remains the single greatest unsolved mystery of the pre-Convergence era. It appeared without warning, killed every dragon except Zunarorth, and vanished. Its origin, motives, and current status (if it still exists) are completely unknown. |

### **Princess Seraphina of Goldhelm**

| Title | Princess Seraphina |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Age** | Young adult |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Family** | Daughter of King Aldric (see: Families of Power — Goldhelm Family) |
| **Role** | Heir to the Goldhelm throne |
| **Abilities** | Seraphina is believed to possess latent magical power that she is not yet aware of. The nature and extent of this power is unknown. This is deeply significant given that magic is completely banned within the Goldhelm Kingdom under penalty of public execution — making the princess herself a potential violation of her own kingdom's most fundamental law. |
| **Personality** | Defiant, perceptive, and resourceful. Seraphina possesses a sharp mind and an unyielding spirit. She is deeply aware of the corruption festering beneath Goldhelm's gilded surface and harbors a genuine desire to see her kingdom reformed. She is not content to be a passive figurehead — she observes, questions, and acts with a courage that often exceeds her station's expectations. Despite her royal upbringing, she is pragmatic and adaptive, capable of enduring hardship without breaking. |
| **Background** | Raised in the Gilded Cradle of Ovodon, Seraphina grew up surrounded by the wealth and rigid hierarchy of the Goldhelm Kingdom. From a young age, she sensed that something was wrong beneath the kingdom's polished exterior — whispers of backroom deals, clandestine meetings, and corruption among the ruling class. Her awareness of these issues has shaped her into a figure who questions authority rather than blindly serving it. |
| **Strategic Importance** | As the sole heir to the Goldhelm throne and a person with undiscovered magical potential, Seraphina is one of the most strategically valuable individuals in Criozevan. Multiple factions — including the Arashi — have recognized her significance. Her latent power, if awakened, could fundamentally alter the balance of power within Goldhelm and potentially across the continent. |

### **King Aldric of Goldhelm**

| Title | King Aldric |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Role** | Ruling monarch of the Goldhelm Kingdom. Head of the Goldhelm Family. |
| **Personality** | A protective father and proud ruler. Aldric governs through the Goldhelm ideology of technocratic isolationism and racial superiority. He is fiercely protective of his daughter Seraphina and his kingdom, willing to mobilize the full resources of the Goldhelm military when either is threatened. |
| **Government** | Rules with a council of advisors from each sector: Scientific, Military, Maritime, Merchants Guild, Northern Criozevan Diplomat, and Southern Criozevan Diplomat. His word is final on matters of state. |

---

### **Sir Elric — Captain of the Goldhelm Guard**

| Title | Sir Elric, Captain of the Guard |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Role** | Captain of the Goldhelm royal guard. King Aldric's most trusted military officer. Personal protector of the royal family. |
| **Abilities** | A seasoned warrior and brilliant tactician. Elric is trained in the full Goldhelm military doctrine and wields holotech weaponry — including a holotech sword. He is known for his strategic mind, capable of reading battlefields and adapting plans under pressure. His combat skills place him among the finest soldiers in the Goldhelm Kingdom. |
| **Personality** | Stoic, loyal, and resolute. Elric's defining trait is his unwavering dedication to the Goldhelm royal family — particularly Princess Seraphina, whom he has protected and mentored since her childhood. He is not a man of many words, preferring action over speech, but when he does speak, his voice carries the weight of hard-earned authority. He is willing to endure any hardship and face any odds in service of his duty. |
| **Background** | Elric rose through the ranks of the Goldhelm military through skill and merit, earning the position of Captain of the Guard — the highest individual military appointment in the kingdom. He stands at King Aldric's right hand in matters of defense and security. His reputation for loyalty and tactical acumen is known throughout the Goldhelm Kingdom. |

### **Lady Isolde — Royal Archmedic of Holometric Sciences**

| Title | Lady Isolde, Royal Archmedic of Holometric Sciences |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Goldhelm |
| **Location** | Ovodon, Goldhelm Kingdom |
| **Role** | Head of all holometric medical science in the Goldhelm Kingdom. Senior advisor to King Aldric. Personal protector and mentor to Princess Seraphina alongside Sir Elric. |
| **Abilities** | Isolde is one of the most accomplished holotech specialists in the Goldhelm Kingdom. Despite common misconceptions, she is not a mage — she uses advanced holotech exclusively, in accordance with Goldhelm law. Her expertise in holometric medicine allows her to generate holotech healing fields, protective energy barriers, and diagnostic systems. She wields a holotech staff that serves as both a medical instrument and a defensive tool. Her skill with holotech is so refined that her work is often mistaken for magic by outsiders unfamiliar with Goldhelm technology. She is revered throughout the kingdom for her wisdom and scientific knowledge. |
| **Personality** | Wise, composed, and fiercely protective. Isolde carries herself with quiet authority — she rarely raises her voice, but when she speaks, her words carry the weight of deep experience and hard-earned knowledge. She is deeply devoted to Princess Seraphina, having watched over her since childhood, and her bond with the princess is maternal in nature. Isolde is willing to sacrifice anything — including her own life — to protect those in her care. Beneath her calm exterior lies an iron will and a sharp strategic mind. |
| **Background** | Isolde rose through the ranks of the Department of Holometric Advancement through exceptional skill in medical applications of holotech. Her appointment as Royal Archmedic placed her at the highest levels of Goldhelm's government, where she serves on King Aldric's council of advisors. Beyond her medical duties, she has become one of the most trusted figures in the royal household — a confidante to the king and a guardian to his daughter. Her relationship with Sir Elric is one of mutual respect and shared duty; together, they form the core of Seraphina's protection. |

### **Anton — The Scarlet Mage**

| Title | Anton |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Race** | Unknown |
| **Magi Type** | Scarlet (Malefici — power prone to losing control) |
| **Base of Operations** | Anton operates from a hidden compound within the Jagged Mountains — a cave system converted into a fortified hideout, with rough-hewn huts built into the rock face. The location is remote, deep within lawless and largely uninhabitable terrain, making it nearly impossible to find without prior knowledge of its existence. |
| **Abilities** | An enormously powerful Scarlet mage. Anton's magic is raw and volatile — capable of overwhelming experienced magic users with sheer force. As a Scarlet, his power can run out of control, making him both incredibly dangerous and inherently unstable. He is capable of generating devastating waves of dark energy, and his power is described as barely contained, his eyes burning with the mark of his Scarlet nature. |
| **Calling Card** | Anton is known to burn a dark, ominous symbol into the ground at locations he has occupied or passed through. The symbol's edges smolder long after his departure. It serves as both a signature and a warning — those who recognize it know that Anton has been there and that pursuit is dangerous. |
| **Personality** | Calculating, manipulative, and patient. Anton is a schemer who operates through proxies, misdirection, and psychological manipulation. He treats captives with an unsettling blend of civility and menace, using cryptic promises and half-truths to bend people toward his goals. He speaks of destiny, hidden power, and the failings of the current order — seductive rhetoric designed to recruit rather than simply coerce. |
| **Affiliations** | Anton has utilized Arashi operatives (specifically Helm and Oto, via Spector's mirror teleportation) but does not appear to be a formal member of the organization. His relationship with the Arashi seems transactional — he pays for services rendered. His deeper allegiances and the full scope of his network remain unknown. |
| **Goals** | Anton's ultimate objectives are shrouded in mystery. He has expressed interest in destabilizing kingdoms, exploiting power vacuums, and awakening hidden potential in individuals he considers strategically valuable. He views the current political order of Criozevan — particularly the Goldhelm Kingdom — as corrupt and doomed, and positions himself as an agent of necessary change. Whether his motives are genuinely ideological or purely self-serving is unclear. |
