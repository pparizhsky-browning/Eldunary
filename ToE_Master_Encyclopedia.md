## III. History

### The Crimson Convergence

The Crimson Convergence is the defining cosmological event of Eldunary — the moment from which all years are measured (**ACC = After Crimson Convergence**).

- A red star appeared in the sky over Eldunary for exactly **40 days**.
- The star drew magic out of the earth and condensed it into tangible forms — primarily **runes**.
- The light caused millions of years of evolution to occur in just 40 days, radically altering all species.
- **Humans** evolved into **Folkwynd**.
- The light was **lethal to Elves**. Every elf it touched died instantly.
  - Surviving elves retreated into thick forests beneath the shadow of the Jagged Mountains. Over generations, they evolved into the **Darkmane Elves**. This region is now known as the Warring Darkmane Realm.
- Magic flooded from the earth into the mountains, **awakening the Golem King** from millions of years of slumber.
- Humans in certain distinct climates evolved differently — giving rise to the **Tharnex**, **Ipadoras**, and **Shar'kai**.
- When the star finally vanished, the new calendar began. All subsequent years are counted from this moment.

> All maps of Criozevan are dated to **Year 1000 ACC**.

Now a diverse but tense metropolis marked by old ruins and district pride.

*District Leaders (now deceased):*
- **Vorvax** (Bug) — Rumored to be the last matriarch of the Tharnex. Ruled from the shadows with shifting armor that sensed incoming danger. Once she was killed, the rest of the Tharnex race perished.
- **Azaraith, the Nightweaver** (Magic) — Feared ruler of the Magic District. Cloaked in shifting darkness, she bent arcane forces with her staff. Even the Arashi hesitated to challenge her. Her mask's face was never revealed.
- **Varnokh** (Death) — A towering armored construct powered by a magenta arcane core. Wielded a massive scythe-axe linked to necromantic energy. Ruled without emotion through death rituals and executions. His core was destroyed by Lucifer; his body was never recovered.

- **Ashglass Hall** — Made of black obsidian and lava glass, glowing with heat veins. Council debates happen beneath molten-stone pillars and hanging lava-stained stalactites.
- **Four High Seats** — Each representing a former district (Bug, Magic, Death, Fire). Elected by district population and surrounding towns. All four seats hold equal voting power.
- **Voice of Sand** — A fifth seat elected by the entire kingdom every five years. Holds power to break ties, pass emergency orders, and represent Fodon internationally. Known as *"the Will of the Wastes."*

**Historical Conflicts**

### State of Akison

### Ipadora Kingdom

**Capital & Settlements**
- **Ipadora Sanctuary** (Capital) — Located on the western side of the Ipadora island. A true sanctuary — almost no crime. Welcomes outsiders, refugees, and peaceful travelers. Has both a surface island city and a vast underwater complex. The Ipadora Palace lies beneath the island in a heavily secured cavern. Heavily patrolled, especially underwater.

- Kingdom is mostly underwater — built in deep oceanic valleys.

- A large manmade river separates its mainland portion from rival kingdoms.
- Underwater landscapes filled with coral structures, bioluminescent flora, and fortified trenches.

- In ancient times, Ipadora controlled much more mainland territory. Lost land after a massive war against the Kingdoms of Fodon and Frada.
- After being driven back, Ipadora cut a river to physically and symbolically separate from its former enemies.
- Despite the loss, Ipadora maintains autonomy and military power through water control.

**Strategic Power**
- Controls all major rivers, sea lanes, and underwater trade routes across Criozevan.
- All kingdoms using waterways must pay taxes or gain permission from Ipadora — a monopoly that makes the kingdom economically and politically powerful.
